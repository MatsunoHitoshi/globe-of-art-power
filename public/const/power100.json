          "content": "At the opening of the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/], conversations centred on the length of the queue to enter the Egyptian Pavilion. People were happy to wait an hour, even two: such was the buzz around Shawky’s video installation Drama 1882. The 45-minute work operatically told the story of the Urabi revolt, the nationalist uprising in the Khedivate of Egypt that ended British imperialism and French influence within the country, with actors (including a donkey) moving through candy-pink sets. Another new work by Shawky, I Am Hymns of the New Temples, debuted concurrently at Venice’s Museo di Palazzo Grimani. Made in collaboration with Pompeii Archaeological Park and developed from extensive archival research, the artist’s film delved into Greek mythology, specifically probing how myths are disseminated. The New Temples film is also included in his show outside of Italy, the Daegu Art Museum in South Korea holding a collection of his installations, films and sculpture, as well as a new film, Love Story (2024), connecting his host country to myths in Egypt and Pompeii. An upcoming show in Seoul early next year at the Barakat Contemporary will complement this with a selection of older works that feature his trademark balance of light-hearted means to depict weighty subjects.\n\nDrama 1882 was the first of Shawky’s work to make use of professional actors, having in the past retold political events using children and puppets. His presence in Venice is a culmination of a body of work that has long playfully picked at colonial pasts and violent events, recasting history as a kind of myth. MASS Alexandria, the independent art school Shawky previously ran, may have gone dormant, but such energies will be put to use in his new role as artistic director of Qatar Museums’ Fire Station, as was announced last month: in addition to developing the artist residency programme, Shawky said he intends turn the space into an educational platform.",

It persuasively links myriad twenty-first-century cultural developments – from experiential art, to first-person narration in fiction and TV, to the personality cult of artists themselves – in their rejection of that foundational quality of artistry, mediation, and ties this in turn to a wider impatience fostered by contemporary capitalism. For Kornbluh, a Chicago-based writer and academic, we’ve been conditioned to expect everything now, frictionlessly, whether art or online shopping, and to sell ourselves too. After reading, you may see everything from the revival of digestible figurative painting to the leveraging of artists’ identities through Kornbluh’s lens. The book’s subtitle boldly positions it as a successor to Fredric Jameson [https://artreview.com/fredric-jameson-1934-2024-in-search-of-an-ending-hannah-proctor-postmodernism-bonaventure/]’s era-defining Postmodernism: Or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1991).

This year, the American artist’s superb touring retrospective What Happened [https://artreview.com/nicole-eisenman-what-happened-museum-brandhorst-munich-review/] reached its only US stop, the MCA Chicago, showcasing queer politics and art historical references alongside evocations of digital anomie and processionlike forays into three dimensions. (It was an apt choice of city, too, since the Chicago Imagists’s mix of humour and scabrousness is part of Eisenman’s artistic DNA.) For a summer autumn show at Hauser & Wirth in Paris, meanwhile, she allowed painting and sculpture to commingle in ways that felt inventive, from paintings with sculptural addenda to paintings of sculpture to, well, just sculptures surrounded by paintings. And in October, doubling down, Eisenman unveiled a monumental public sculpture – an assisted readymade of a toppled 1969 crane titled Fixed Crane – in New York’s Madison Square Park.",

Parallel to his exhibition at Hauser & Wirth Hong Kong, the artist collaborated with young people involved with Bridge+ Living Art Space, a community centre in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, working with them to make a mural. Bradford introduced these students to his distinct brand of political abstraction: vast canvases of collage and paint incorporating aesthetics referencing the posters, products and materials of the Los Angeles neighbourhoods he grew up in. Such is Bradford’s vision of the ‘artist as citizen’: in 2013, he cofounded the nonprofit Art + Practice in South Los Angeles, and for the past eight years (starting in the leadup to representing the United States at the 2017 Venice Biennale) the artist has collaborated with Venetian nonprofit Rio Terà dei Pensieri, which provides employment to those currently or recently incarcerated in the Veneto region.",

Sherald found fame with her 2018 official portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama, and now almost 50 of the painter’s portraits, dating from 2007 to today, of Black figures shown at leisure, in love or modelling bright, exuberant clothes, form American Sublime, a retrospective that opened at the San Francisco Museum of Art in November. In 2025 the show travels to the Whitney in New York and finally to the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC, where Sherald will be the first Black female artist to present a solo exhibition. ‘Figuration is important because it’s a definite mark and a stamp that I was here, in a narrative that was absent of our presence,’ Sherald told Harper’s Bazaar. That presence can be felt in the numerous US and UK group shows she appeared in too, including The Time is Always Now: Artists Reframe the Black Figure [https://artreview.com/the-time-is-always-now-artists-reframe-the-black-figure-national-portrait-gallery-london-review/] at London’s National Portrait Gallery.",

In March, Venice’s Palazzo Grassi staged Mehretu’s largest exhibition [https://artreview.com/the-fantasy-architecture-of-julie-mehretu-palazzo-grassi-venice-review/] in Europe to date, with more than 50 works on show. Such is the artist’s standing, however, that she invited some of her ‘closest friends’ along for the ride: her practice contextualised with works by Nairy Baghramian, Huma Bhabha, Tacita Dean, David Hammons, Robin Coste Lewis, Paul Pfeiffer and Jessica Rankin. The next generation might also have reason to be thankful: in October she donated $2.1m to the Whitney Museum [https://artreview.com/admission-fees-to-whitney-museum-to-be-scrapped-for-under-25s-julie-mehretu/] in New York, where she is a trustee, to ensure free entry to all visitors twenty-five and under for the next three years. She’s breaking free from the canvas too: this year Mehretu designed the BMW Art Car, her work appearing on the bodywork of the racing M Hybrid V8, and Barack Obama commissioned a 25m-tall stained-glass window for his forthcoming presidential museum and library in Chicago. Meanwhile, the artist’s first exhibition in the Asia-Pacific region just opened at MCA Australia in Sydney.",

Such a dynamic approach has more recently been applied to museum holdings in her book Potential History: Unlearning Imperialism (2019) and films including Un-Documented: Unlearning Imperial Plunder (2019), as well as in an exhibition of drawings (made from archival photos she wasn’t permitted to reproduce) this year in Bristol. Describing herself as ‘an Arab Jew and a Palestinian Jew of African origins’, the Brown University professor tackled her own family history this year in her book The Jewelers of the Ummah: A Potential History of the Jewish Muslim World (2024).",

Mid-Career Artist (2024) – the most Instagrammed element of his selfie-culture-critiquing New York show Social Media at Lisson, which he recently joined – expands the American artist’s roster of precarity-inhabiting human subjects rendered as hyperrealist sculptures and tucked, like trash, into clear plastic bags. In his current show at MoCA LA, Kline laid out what we’re ignoring while staring at our phones: Climate Change (2018–) is a sculptural installation imagining a near-future dystopia following catastrophic sea-level rises. On-the-nose and technically neophiliac – from deepfakes to state-of-the-art 3D-printing – Kline’s art is arguably the clearest and most unnerving artistic articulation of where we’re going as a species, and how human dignity is steadily lost in the process.

The Electronic Diaries was the centrepiece of her exhibition at the Julia Stoschek Foundation in Düsseldorf – which surveyed five decades of performance, photography, video, interactive net-based media and robotic art – and it featured in her MoMA, New York, film retrospective in June. At eighty-three, Hershman Leeson is still innovating (BAMPFA paid tribute to her achievements as a ‘creative visionary’ exploring feminism and technology); the us exhibition also included her four-part ‘Cyborg Series’, including Cyborgian Rhapsody – Immortality (2023), written, performed and designed by an artificial intelligence chatbot, while the artist’s earlier New York show at Bridget Donahue featured Eternally Yours (2023), a sculpture that housed a refrigerated antiaging vaccine. ‘There’s no need to be afraid of these new tools,’ the techno-optimist artist assured Artnet.",

The Ramallah-based pair have taken both Palestine and the wider turbulence of the Arab world as their subject matter for over a decade, establishing a practice that mixes politics with astute technical filmmaking, lyrical poetry and discombobulating soundtracks. Much-praised participation in last year’s Sharjah Biennial 15 (‘a striking installation’, thought Art in America, one that ‘transmitted memory of the dispossession of the Palestinian people in all its bitterness and melancholy’, said Artforum) has been followed in 2024 by solo exhibitions at the Reina Sofía, in Madrid; MIT List Visual Arts Center, in Cambridge, MA (travelling to Carleton College, in Northfield, Minnesota, in 2025); Copenhagen Contemporary and the Glyptotek; and Coleção Moraes-Barbosa in São Paulo. Visitors to the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] had a chance to see their work at Fondazione In Between Art Film [https://artreview.com/nebula-complesso-dellospedaletto-venice-review-mariacarla-mole/], while a European touring show is scheduled to open at Nottingham Contemporary next year.

Such a proclamation reinforced the artist’s ongoing commitment to educational initiatives and community building: in 2019 he won a Marcantonio Vilaça Award, the most prominent art prize in Brazil, and used the cash reward to establish Sertão Negro, a cultural centre located near to his studio in Goiânia. In addition to hosting community events, the centre offers monthlong residencies to national and international artists, whose first week is spent in one of two local quilombos – settlements originally established by escaped enslaved people. Aside from featuring in a group show in June at Mariane Ibrahim in Mexico City, Paula was a major presence in Adriano Pedrosa’s Venice Biennale exhibition [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/], which included works from his Full-Body Portraits series [https://artreview.com/can-there-be-history-without-facts-feature-izabella-scott/#:~:text=the%20Brazilian%20painter-,Dalton%20Paula,-%2C%20who%20portrays%20Black] (2023–24) – 16 paintings depicting historical figures of African descent who were involved in antislavery movements in Brazil.",

It’s a subtlety that attracted Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung [https://artreview.com/artist/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung/] to tap Souza for his curatorial team for the 2025 Bienal de São Paulo [https://artreview.com/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung-to-curate-the-36th-bienal-de-sao-paulo/], and that was on display in Some May Work as Symbols at London’s Raven Row, cocurated with Pablo Lafuente, which studied the overlapping of Afro-Brazilian heritage and geometric abstraction in Brazil during the mid-twentieth century. Topography of Memory, a largescale installation by Sallisa Rosa that Souza curated for Audemars Piguet Contemporary during Art Basel Miami travelled to Pinacoteca de São Paulo, and he worked with curator Matheus Morani on For Another Ecology at Solar dos Abacaxis, Rio de Janeiro, featuring the likes of Julien Creuzet and Rose Afefé to address environmental racism.

Maintaining their work as plantation labourers, the artists have used revenues resulting from sales of their palm oil and cocoa sculptures to buy up and restore plantation land around Lusanga. In 2017 CATPC built a ‘white cube’ art gallery on land they had reclaimed, which this year was connected by livestream to the group’s standout exhibition at the Dutch Pavilion [https://artreview.com/the-congolese-collective-catpc-on-representing-the-netherlands-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] (worked on with Renzo Martens, a longtime collaborator, and Hicham Khalidi). With a major exhibition at Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, opening this December, following appearances at the Diriyah Biennale and Paris Internationale, CATPC’s short-circuiting of the global artworld’s power relations takes institutional critique one step further.",

The site was gifted to them by a family from Jerusalem, and the pair have spent the last few years renovating and rewilding this land. Self-dubbed ‘a progressive academy’ that’s dedicated to agricultural research, Sakiya integrates local agrarian knowledge with ecological processes and contemporary art. The organisation’s activities include food production, exhibitions and conferences, as well as residencies and workshops enriched by a network of artists, writers, ecologists and craftspeople, both from the region and abroad. Sakiya’s force lies in the educational model it has created that roots pedagogy within the landscape, cultivating knowledge exchange and strategies of subsistence that seem all the more radical and necessary in the face of genocide and environmental collapse. Its ultimate goal is to challenge ‘the demographic divide that characterizes cultural production and consumption in Palestine’.",

Curated by Ellie Buttrose, Moore’s vast black-and-white installation took the form of a genealogical chart that wrapped around the walls and ceiling of the cavernous space, highlighting 65,000 years of human history and interconnectedness. In the centre of the pavilion was a raised tablelike platform, set above a dark pool of water, on top of which were placed 500 document-stacks largely consisting of partially redacted coroners’ inquests relating to Indigenous Australians who had died while held in police custody. Moore’s work combines the personal with the political, and this global art event in Italy was used by the artist to bring visibility to the violence and injustices perpetrated by carceral systems in his country, and around the world, that disproportionately target Indigenous people and people of colour. It was announced in August that kith and kin has been jointly acquired by Brisbane’s Queensland Art Gallery / Gallery of Modern Art and London’s Tate Modern.",

Yan Du extends her advocacy through a series of public institutional partnerships in London, including a curatorial research fellowship at Chisenhale Gallery; a curatorial fellowship at the Whitechapel Gallery; a lecture series at the Courtauld Gallery; a PhD scholarship at Goldsmiths; residencies at the Delfina Foundation; and, new this year, two curatorial positions at Tate Modern. Most recently Asymmetry has been expanding its international footprint, announcing a new curatorial fellowship in partnership with New York’s Sculpture Center.

In 1982 she created Wheatfield – A Confrontation, nearly an entire hectare of wheat planted and harvested on a plot of land in the shadow of New York’s Twin Towers: a work of Land art protesting capitalist greed and the degradation of the planet. The gesture was repeated this year both in a plot of land neighbouring Tinworks Art in Bozeman, Montana, and on moveable pallets outside Art Basel, the confrontation of the art market and Denes’s protest deliciously uncomfortable. What the interest in these new iterations did demonstrate was how much, amid a worsening climate emergency, the artworld and its own increasing attention to the study of land, ecofeminism and the relationship between humanity and the environment, has caught up with Denes’s way of thinking. This year she had institutional shows at the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest (the city in which she was born), and Lunds Konsthall, in Sweden (where she grew up), and participated in nine major group shows. Denes, at ninety-three, refuses to slow down – her next project: how to create ‘vertical fields’.",

Dealers told Ocula that sales at Art Basel Hong Kong were just ‘okay’, while visitor numbers were ‘thin’, and exhibitors also had to negotiate the new censorious national security law introduced by the territory’s legislators (Art Basel has signed a new three-year partnership with Hong Kong’s tourist board; the fair also has a partnership with Art Week Tokyo, possibly indicating a hedging of their Asian presence). At the Swiss edition of the fair, however, there was a ‘sigh of relief’ after day one. This art fair model remains a gallery’s safest route to sales: 195 dealers, an increase of 27 percent from last year, signed up to take part in Art Basel Paris, now established in the newly renovated Grand Palais. Offsetting the growing nervousness, the Miami edition has offered smaller, cheaper booths for the first time, to increase the fair’s accessibility for participating galleries.",

Bringing together multiple environmental datasets, the model experiments with the possibility that AI might be trained to find insights in ecological rather than human-produced information, with iterations appearing at Google’s annual conference and the United Nations. And with artist and studio cofounder Efsun Erkılıç, Anadol has recently announced Dataland, a permanent museum and centre for AI arts, set to open in LA next year.",

Screenings continued this year for AI: African Intelligence (2022), which hitches life and ritual in African fishing villages to the emergence of artificial intelligence, and ponders an Africanised relationship to algorithms; as well as Angela Davis: A World of Greater Freedom (2023), which articulates the activist’s ideas on freedom, resistance, prison abolition and more.

Simultaneously in London he appeared in museum group exhibitions related to textiles and British colonial history.

In Nigeria Shonibare also inaugurated his first public sculpture in Lagos, where the artist spent a part of his childhood. Meanwhile, he continued to pay it forward via his five-year-old nonprofit GAS residency programme in Lagos and Ijebu (which welcomed over 20 new residents this year), facilitating exchange between diverse practitioners in order, it appears, to alter the fabric of culture itself.",

AAA launched new collections on independent art spaces in Taiwan, as well as the Siu King Chung Archive, which features materials about Hong Kong art and the development of self-organised art practices in particular, from the 1980s to the 2000s. It also opened two research-intensive exhibitions. Another Day in Hong Kong included interviews with over a hundred individuals from Hong Kong’s art community about their recollections of 19 October 1996 (this was identified as being the median day out of all the dates in AAA’s HK-based records).

Early in the year, Mohebbi brought the moving-image strand of 2023’s Taipei Biennial [https://artreview.com/taipei-biennial-2023-small-world-review-taipei-fine-arts-museum/] to the US, featuring works by Li Yi-Fan [https://artreview.com/li-yi-fan-wins-the-golden-harvest-award/], Jen Liu [https://artreview.com/jen-liu-i-am-cloud-blindspot-gallery-hong-kong-review-aaina-bhargava/] and Jumana Manna, among others (and in a neat extramural East–West flip, he curated the film programme of Art Week Tokyo in November). Meanwhile, the institution spotlighted all kinds of simultaneously forward-thinking and slantwise practice: from Bastien Gachet’s complex self-described ‘dramaturgy’ of faked and fabricated objects to Phoebe Collings-James’s abject ceramics. This summer saw artist and choreographer Alexa West use the art centre as a stage for constantly unfolding rehearsals, exploring the intersection of dance and sculpture. In a recent piece collecting ‘notes to self’ for Mousse, Mohebbi invoked the Caribbean notion of ‘mawonaj’, meaning to be pointedly difficult to pin down. At Sculpture Center, he’s walking the talk.",

The postponement provided some unexpected respite from a very busy year. In October Fonseca opened Fullgás at CCBB Rio de Janeiro, a survey of visual art in Brazil during the 1980s featuring approximately 300 works by over 200 artists. Fonseca was also touring Frieze London in October, as part of a purchasing committee for Tate, while acting as a curatorial adviser to the Prospect 6 triennial in New Orleans, which opened in November. Fonseca is now gearing up for Counterpublic in 2026, the citywide exhibition in St Louis that has appointed him as part of a five-strong curatorial committee. Fonseca has a day job, too. As curator of modern and contemporary Latin American art at Denver Art Museum, he opened an exhibition in April of Chilean artist Sandra Vásquez de la Horra’s fantasy-inflected paintings and drawings.",

Weaponry is a fitting motif for the artist: he has been uncompromising in his fight against the misappropriation of Indigenous visual culture and the collective amnesia towards the colonial crimes of the past. Such anger was unflinchingly disclosed in the red neon text work Galanin made for his exhibition, Interference Patterns, at SITE Santa Fe in January, which read, over a grid of doormats, ‘I’ve Composed a New National Anthem: Take a Knee and Scream Until You Can’t Breathe’. The howl is being heard. Galanin was also included in a dozen group shows this year, including the Public Art Abu Dhabi Biennial and the Toronto Biennial, and in April he received a Guggenheim Fellowship.",

That’s the kind of expansionist vision Ginwala brings to curating. ‘Dense, multi-sensory, and rhizomatic, it speaks through entanglements and intersections’ – this was e-flux Criticism’s assessment of Colomboscope, the festival Ginwala has directed in Sri Lanka since 2019. With curators Sheelasha Rajbhandari, Hit Man Gurung and Sarker Protick, this year’s iteration took nature, ecofeminism and Indigeneity as its themes and soon spread beyond the gallery. It is, Ginwala said, a ‘perspective that rises beyond the geopolitical fragmentations that our part of the world faces’. Such an approach will likely be detected in the section she is curating at the Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] in February (she is one of a five-strong team of curators). Ginwala has said ‘the ancient stepwells in Indian Ocean littoral sites and water wells found in Sharjah’s historic households and courtyards’ will serve as her personal leitmotifs [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/], ones ‘that avow ancestral memory, place-making, sonic remembrance and cross-generational convening amidst tides of annihilation’.",

Spora, her ongoing ‘environmental institutional critique’ programming, was augmented with an intervention by Pulitzer Prize-winning artist Raven Chacon, while the ambitious group show Energies, staged across the Swiss Institute’s three storeys as well as in other community locations throughout the East Village, garnered critical acclaim – a reviewer calling it ‘one of the boldest curatorial feats… in recent memory’. Tapping into the local history of a sweat-equity co-op (which powered through the 1973 oil crisis with its own wind turbine and went on to win a legal battle against energy giant Con Edison), the show mixed archival material with intergenerational artistic perspectives on the universal and urgent topic of energy to demonstrate the power of cooperation and community organisation in the face of environmental collapse.

Frieze, under CEO Fox, is adept at making an art fair feel like an event, and this year added to its US footprint not only by moving the West Coast edition to Santa Monica Airport but by hosting the recently acquired Expo Chicago and the Armory Show in New York. ‘The economics of art fairs are challenging,’ Fox told the same reporter in March. Referring to Emanuel’s Endeavor, Frieze’s parent company, he added, ‘We are taken very seriously by Ari and the team’. A month is a long time in business. A few weeks later Endeavor was taken private (after equity fund Silver Lake bought the $13b of stock it didn’t already own), and the group is now considering selling the art fair in a pessimistic market: just ‘moderate sales’ were reported at the third edition of Frieze Seoul, though the London original was deemed more successful, helped by the sale of a number of works to several UK institutional collections (aided by Endeavor-funded partnerships with the fair) including the Contemporary Art Society, Tate and the Arts Council.",

Barnes, an early collector of African art, and Alain Locke, the Harlem Renaissance instigator and proponent of restitution, with all the sensuality that has become characteristic of the British artist’s work. The film was exhibited this year at the Whitney Biennial [https://artreview.com/whitney-biennial-2024-new-york-review/], New York, and MCA Australia, Sydney, where The Sydney Morning Herald, ‘in an age where so-called political and postcolonial art tends toward sermonising’, found the film ‘unexpectedly healing’. Julien’s work meditates on the sins of the past, finding balm in the intersection of race and sexuality, not least in Lessons of the Hour (2019), his cinematic portrait of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, which was shown for eight months in New York, first at Skidmore College’s Tang Museum and then at MoMA (Julien’s iconic Looking for Langston, 1989, is also currently on show there as part of the permanent collection). Meanwhile, Julien became Fellow of the British Academy this year, and his survey exhibition, What freedom is to me, travelled to Bonnefanten, Maastrich.",

The biennale, originally set to open in December 2024, was postponed by a year following a period of concern that it might be cancelled completely. This was due to a debt owed to the event’s waterfront venue since its first edition in 2012. These issues have now been resolved, with new private patrons coming to the rescue and a new chair (former director general of the National Museum in Delhi, Venu Vasudevan). This year the biennial, in partnership with Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation, presented the inaugural New Dialogues: Contemporary Art From South Asia conference at London’s Southbank Centre. Meanwhile, Krishnamachari, who also makes art, can now put ‘gallerist’ on his CV: in October he opened a contemporary space inside the new Bangalore store of interior design studio Dtale, showing works by Astha Butail, Harisha Chennangod, Pooja Iranna and Prajakta Potnis.",

Now staged in collaboration with Art Basel (Ninagawa sits on the fair’s selection committee for its Basel edition), the event draws an international crowd and is eager to establish a new hub in Asia to rival Seoul and away from the censorship present in Hong Kong and mainland China. Over 50 galleries and museums across the city took part in the event, which included a selling show at Okura Museum of Art curated by Mami Kataoka, and AWT Video, a series of moving image works programmed by Sohrab Mohebbi that screened at SMBC East Tower.",

The founder and director of African Artists’ Foundation, the 16-year-old nonprofit arts organisation, and Lagos Photo Festival has been preoccupied with questions of survival: in 2020 the foundation was evicted from its base by its landlords, unfairly it claims, which has put its activities on hiatus.

The book, which has evolved from the Feral Atlas online project, considers (as has come to be expected from the UC Santa Cruz professor), the unexpected outcomes and responsibilities of humanity’s methods of populating and extracting from the planet – as told through the nonhuman presence of, for example, beetles, water hyacinths and dry rot fungus. While this year saw publication of a new edition of her 2004 book Friction, using forest fires in Indonesia to reflect on globalisation, her more recent articles and talks have focused on concrete and how its use in the built environment precipitates floods. As climates continue to shift, artists continue to look to Tsing to help map the new terrain.",

The artist’s comment relates to his interest in taking money out of the West, through the sale of such sculptures, and funnelling it back into Tamale, the region of northern Ghana where the artist was raised and still lives. There he has built three institutions [https://artreview.com/ibrahim-mahama-builds-museums-of-the-future/], Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art, Red Clay Studio and Nkrumah Volini, each with its own programme of exhibitions and education initiatives. This reparative practice has won him fans: institutional shows this year include Fruitmarket, Edinburgh; Barbican Centre, London; and Mönchehaus Museum Goslar; while newly commissioned works were presented at the Lagos Biennial and Desert X AlUla, Saudi Arabia.",

In Black Meme, Russell traces how, from the days of silent cinema to TikTok and GIFs, the Black subject has been reduced to archetype, not least via the hyperviolent ‘viral’ imagery of slain figures such as Emmett Till or Philando Castile, while likening the distribution of souvenir postcards of public lynchings to the sharing of memes. Russell isn’t just commenting on visual culture; she has a mission to change it. She told Vanity Fair, ‘Many people would agree that the artworld is in a state of disarray… We’re seeing many failures and also through those failures many opportunities to change.’ This year, the curator’s group show on ‘black data’, Code Switch: Distributing Blackness, Reprogramming Internet Art, organised by The Kitchen across various US venues, and a presentation at Berggruen Arts & Culture in Venice by artist and poet Rhea Dillon helped further that cause.",

If these are in keeping with current curatorial fashions, they have been López’s interests for a while, from his early days running Teorética in San José, Costa Rica, and as evergreen chief champion of Cecilia Vicuña. The Chilean artist was included in Toronto, marking the latest chapter in a relationship dating back to a 2019 retrospective López curated at the Witte de With (now Kunstinstituut Melly), Rotterdam, and which travelled to Mexico City, Madrid and Bogotá. Dreaming Water, a second survey of the artist’s work curated by López, opened this year at the Pinacoteca de São Paulo, following stops at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago, and MALBA, Buenos Aires. In April, López delivered the keynote lecture at the 2024 Curatorial Forum conference (organised by Independent Curators International), which focused on art and civic responsibility.",

In 15 years the Rajas have not only built and established two galleries in the city and a third in Mumbai, but also an entire ecosystem, created through the Experimenter Curators’ Hub, which held its 14th edition this year; their online learning-orientated Experimenter Labs; Experimenter Books; an outpost exhibition programme that ‘inhabits disused, characterful spaces’; and the Generator Co-operative Art Production Fund, which offers small bursaries for art production. TRI opened with solo shows by Experimenter artists Prabhakar Pachpute and Kallol Datta, while at the same time during Mumbai Gallery Weekend the Rajas staged exhibitions by Afrah Shafiq and Alexandra Bachzetsis, and camp’s monumental 2022 seven-channel installation Bombay Tilts Down could be seen in the open air down at the city’s docks. This autumn, Sohrab Hura opened his first US survey show at New York’s MoMA PS1.",

City Hall’s disapproval apparently related to an exhibition programme that lacked tourist-friendly crowd-pleasers (2024 shows included solos for tech-focused sculptor Aleksandra Domanović and experimental filmmaker Diego Marcon [https://artreview.com/diego-marcons-hollow-people/]), as well as poor visitor numbers (though WHW’s tenure coincided with the pandemic). The termination of WHW’s employment caused one member of the institution’s board to quit; meanwhile, the trio left a valedictory postscript in the form of a 62m mural by Nora Turato reading, ‘Aaaaaaaa…!!!!!!’ – the first of an annual public artwork commission established during WHW’s time in office. They won’t be dwelling on the past, though: WHW’s departure gives them more time to prepare for the 2027 edition of Skulptur Projekte Münster. Their appointment as the first female curators of the exhibition was announced [https://artreview.com/what-how-for-whom-to-direct-skulptur-projekte-munster-2027/] in August.",

Over the past five years she has been scandalising conservative critics and audiences at the stately Swiss theatre Schauspielhaus Zürich in her role as a guest director by staging avant-garde updates to canonical works including Orpheus (2021), Pinocchio (2022) and The Tempest (2024), while increasing gender and racial diversity in the productions. (The magnificent Moby-Dick; or, The Whale [https://artreview.com/wu-tsang-of-whales-thyssen-bornemisza-museo-nacional-madrid-moby-dick-review/], 2022, a silent film retelling Herman Melville’s novel, premiered there, and has since travelled the world to acclaim.) Together with her longtime collaborators, the open collective Moved by the Motion, Wu closed her stint at the Schauspielhaus with a hybrid operatic-theatrical take on Georges Bizet’s 1875 Carmen. The show received mixed reviews – but judging by the upcoming touring schedule of Wu’s projects, she’ll be keeping busy.",

His research culminated in a survey show this year at Goldsmiths CCA in London, which featured, among other things, a new commission that drew connections between extraction and Belgian art nouveau, and a collaborative performance that recounted the story of the first Black bishop appointed by the Catholic Church in the fifteenth century. But Baloji’s actual power lies in his role as a catalyst for his hometown’s art scene: as a cofounder of an independent association that supports local artists, Atelier Picha, he has been instrumental in establishing the Lubumbashi Biennale, which launched its 8th edition in October under the title Towards an Antidote to Toxicity. Focusing on the legacy of Congolese thinker Valentin-Yves Mudimbe, this year’s iteration seeks to imagine the possibilities of anticolonial engagement with the colonial archive through the works of artists from across the country and beyond.",

In March Essers supported a show of Lindokuhle Sobekwa’s photographs at the Johannesburg Art Gallery; while the Cape Town space held exhibitions for multimedia artists Mikhael Subotzky and Alfredo Jaar. The London gallery opened a survey of the late painter Atta Kwami, which moved to the New York space, complementing its inaugural full year of programming, featuring Misheck Masamvu, Zineb Sedira and Kapwani Kiwanga, among others. Meanwhile, visitors to the Cheetah Plains luxury safari lodge on the Sabi Sand Nature Reserve may have gone for the lions and leopards, but could stay for the art: in January it opened a private art gallery in partnership with Goodman Gallery, to the delight of its the wildlife-hungry holidaymakers.",

He’s also a stylist whose steady stream of digestibly short, aphorism-filled books pair well with social media-tinged attention spans. Titling his 2023 book Via Contemplativa: In Praise of Inactivity might seem a little at odds, coming from such a prolific writer, though it’s a paean to the unhurried contemplation of reality, rather than commendation for doing nothing at all. And if said reality gives you the shivers, this year the Korean-German thinker published the Anselm Kiefer-illustrated The Spirit of Hope – ‘a plea against the crisis of fear’ by the same writer who also in 2024 put out The Crisis of Narration, which lamented the loss of richly complex storytelling and the social media-fuelled shift towards ‘storyselling’. Problems everywhere, then, but it’s all grist to Han’s fast-moving diagnostic mill.",

With a new Basel address and a second London space opening next year, Hauser & Wirth, run by husband and wife Iwan and Manuela, alongside Payot as president, will shortly equal Gagosian’s real estate. It is ‘a whole world you step into’, consultant Barbara Guggenheim told the Financial Times. She was not just talking about a global reach that spans from Hollywood to Hong Kong to Gstaad to New York, nor the 103 artists and artists’ estates the gallery promotes (veterans William Kentridge, Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/] and Nairy Baghramian joined the roster this year, as well as youngster George Rouy and Michaela Yearwood-Dan). The trio have also established themselves as lifestyle purveyors via their ‘art centres’ in Somerset and Menorca, and, above all, through Iwan and Manuela’s loss-leading Artfarm hospitality company, which owns restaurants, hotels, pubs and, not least, London’s Groucho Club, all adorned with the work of gallery artists. If, as one cynic put it, also to the FT, ‘galleries are event organisers for rich and lonely people’, then Hauser & Wirth definitely fills the void.",

Mbembe’s most recent book, The Earthly Community (2022), presents the bleak trajectory of technocapitalism, but also posits a possible escape route through African cosmologies and the power of African aesthetics and figurative objects. The author has been touring his book globally and received rave reviews for his radical call for an African future: in June he gave a lecture at the University of Bergen (while receiving the Holberg Prize, the first African to do so), and in November he was billed as the star attraction of the biennial Maputo Fast Forward Festival. In São Paulo for the 9th International Theatre Festival, he told Veja that ‘we must fight to ensure that no person of African descent is a stranger in Africa’, arguing that the continent should institute a right of return.",

Vicuña suffered as a result, for decades often at the brink of destitution but continuing nonetheless with her knotted textile sculptures, agitprop paintings and poetry. Now the world is eager to listen, what with the eco-feminist and Indigenous turn in artmaking that Vicuña’s work has always embodied. Dreaming Water, one of several recent retrospectives, which opened in Santiago and Buenos Aires last year, arrived at the Pinacoteca of São Paulo in May, while Pérez Art Museum Miami installed a nine-metre quipus, one of the artist’s cascading sculptures of unspun wool. Her work was present in 15 group shows this year, including Pacific Standard Time, California, and two biennials (Malta and Toronto). In addition, the artist presented spoken word performances at venues including Triple Canopy, New York; Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; and Tate Britain, London. In November, Vicuña was awarded $100,000 as a recipient [https://artreview.com/julian-charriere-and-cecilia-vicuna-win-inaugural-environment-and-art-prize/] of the inaugural MoCA Los Angeles Eric and Wendy Schmidt Environment and Art Prize.",

The group has long worked in Palestine, and in January the first exhibition of its Ramallah-based offshoot, the Forensic Architecture Investigation (FAI) Unit, was staged at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Arts and Sciences. The exhibition displayed its trademark analysis of found field recordings, media imagery and satellite pictures, as well as 3D animated reconstructions used to create second-by-second retellings of contested events. The unit, set up in 2020, is a collaboration with Al-Haq, a human rights organisation, but one that has been designated a terrorist group by Israel’s Ministry of Defense, and Forensic Architecture has been the subject of much criticism from commentators, particularly in Germany. Shows at Württembergische Kunstverein Stuttgart and Museum im Kulturspeicher (MiK), Würzburg, both concerning racist and anti-immigration violence in Germany, went ahead, however.\n\nThe methodology they pioneered, in applying aesthetic analysis to news and events, has proven widely influential, while affiliates and former members, including artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan [https://artreview.com/artist/lawrence-abu-hamdan/] and curator Anselm Franke, have spread this further in their own work. Positioning artistic tools and interdisciplinary creative research as means to generate evidence of what they term ‘state and corporate violence’, their work’s proposal of art as something that can be instrumentalised is apparently an alluring one for many artists, suggesting art installation as antidote to an image-dominated, post-truth landscape. The current show at CIVA, Brussels, shows their 2023 work on prehistoric architecture in what is now Ukraine; their work on former plantations in Louisiana, USA, becoming petrochemical factories on view at the Wellcome Collection, London; and a selection of their ongoing work on medical staff in Gaza over the past year being exhibited in Vienna. Alongside museum exhibitions also in Istanbul, Portland and Cali, and biennials in Rotterdam and Yogyakarta, their work continues to have both global focus and audiences.",

Funding arts programmes has long been a focus within that framework: in 2024 alone this has ranged from the $1.1m the foundation gave to bankroll Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/]’s pavilion at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] (Gibson was the first Indigenous artist to represent the US at the event), to the $500k each given to the Los Angeles Museum of Art, New York’s The Kitchen and the Whitney (specifically for the exhibition of choreographer and Civil Rights activist Alvin Ailey), and the $2k given to National Portrait Gallery staffers to attend a migrant justice conference. Eyeing up his future spare time, in October Walker, already a trustee to the Smithsonian, became president [https://artreview.com/darren-walker-helms-national-gallery-of-art-washington-d-c/] of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.",

Her reach is wide: a new Japanese translation of the writer, thinker and cultural historian’s 2006 book Lose Your Mother won Japan’s Best Translation Award this year. All of this continues to spread her work and her influential methods of delving into archives, exploring their gaps and absences, and reanimating them with both academic rigor and the tools of fiction, what she refers to as ‘critical fabulation’. Her aim in 2019’s Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments [https://artreview.com/can-there-be-history-without-facts-feature-izabella-scott/#:~:text=The%20US%20scholar%20Saidiya%20Hartman], as she wrote, of ‘reconstructing the experience of the unknown and retrieving minor lives from oblivion’ could also be read as a guide for many artists working today.\n\nThis year, while teaching in the English Department at Columbia University and continuing work on a book about unsung heroes of Black radicalism (under the title Graces of the Unsung), and alongside her inclusion in the publication Five Manifestos for the Beautiful World (2024, based on a lecture series from last year), Hartman resumed her ongoing collaboration with artist Arthur Jafa [https://artreview.com/artist/arthur-jafa/?year=2020] through an ambitious three-part multimedia performance, Minor Music at the End of the World. Commissioned by Hartwig Art Foundation and currently in rehearsal, with theorist Tina Campt involved as dramaturg, the production is based on two of Hartman’s essays, ‘The End of White Supremacy: An American Romance’ and ‘Litany for Grieving Sisters’. It also draws on the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, particularly his science fiction story ‘The Comet’, published in 1920 in the wake of the Great Influenza pandemic, in which a black man and a white woman are the sole survivors of an apocalyptic event. Hartman and Jafa’s work will premiere in Amsterdam next year, and the questions it promises to raise testify to Hartman’s conceptual scope and hopefulness: ‘How does one live at the end of the world? Is it possible to envision a world without racism? And what would be required to produce such a world?’",

The French government will cover the cost of this technical work, but Le Bon needs to find a further €207m from sponsors. Le Bon and his predecessor’s primary strategy has been an aggressive franchise model, in which international cities pay to use the Pompidou name for five years (renewable) and have access to its 120,000-strong collection and expertise: Málaga took up the offer in 2015 (its ten-year contract was renewed this year), and Shanghai followed in 2019 (secured through 2028), while Brussels and Seoul outposts are due to open next year [https://artreview.com/centre-pompidou-to-open-contemporary-art-museum-in-saudi-arabia/]. The future of Pompidou New Jersey remains up in the air, however: the US state previously pulled out of the deal, but a new funding plan has put it back on the table – for now. While closed for renovation, Centre Pompidou plans to disperse its collection and expertise across France’s network of museums.",

Weems, who was awarded the US National Medal of Arts [https://artreview.com/carrie-mae-weems-awarded-2024-national-medal-of-arts/] by the departing President Biden in October, also revisited The Kitchen Table, her 1990 series of images capturing a fictional drama featuring the artist herself amid scenes of Black American domestic life. She referenced the project in a commission for fashion brand Bottega Veneta, with a campaign showing rapper A$AP Rocky and his baby child sitting down for dinner. Two works from the original series were included in a tv advertisement for Kamala Harris, and Weems produced a billboard for the Democratic presidential candidate, as well as hosting a programme of readings, live music and food at New York’s Gladstone Gallery on election day.",

Time & the Tiger offers insight into Ho’s two-decade career spent critically mining Southeast Asian identity and history through video, installation and performances. The show also marked the debut of T for Time, an ambitious investigation into the nature of time, which Ho says is ‘the true substance or material with which [he] work[s]’. Comprising animation clips shuffled by an algorithm, the video installation explores temporality through disciplines such as horology, geopolitics, physics, biology and philosophy, as well as more subjective experiences of time, such as through memory and ageing. Ho, whose work has been described by curator Shabbir Hussain Mustafa as an ‘embodiment of a political ethos that challenges conventional hierarchies in our understanding of the past’, could also be seen at this year’s Whitney Biennial [https://artreview.com/whitney-biennial-2024-new-york-review/], or receiving €100,000 as a winner of the Chanel Next Prize 2024 [https://artreview.com/chanel-next-prize-2024-announces-winners/].",

The programme was organised as a collaboration between the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, where Andrew is adjunct curator, and the University of Melbourne, where he is ‘director of reimagining museums and collections’, and where he founded BLAK C.O.R.E., a collective driven by First Nations methodologies, research and cultural practice. Andrew continues as artistic associate of the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, where he is curating a show on global Indigeneity in 2026. There was also a public lightwork for Footscray, a suburb of Melbourne, featuring Andrew’s trademark black-and-white Op-art patterning; and preparations are underway for a second architectural commission, next to Sydney Central station. Now represented by Sydney- and Singapore-based Ames Yavuz, he had a show earlier in the year at Frieze’s No. 9 Cork Street gallery in London, alongside Pinaree Sanpitak.",

He created Listening All Night to the Rain, a disorientating walk-through featuring 62 screens that played 31 hours of footage and archival material, with references ranging from Stokely Carmichael to Mark Rothko, and which meditated on the artist’s enduring themes of memory, migration, racial injustice and climate change, while asking audiences to ‘attune’ to an ‘ethics of sonics’ that served as the installation’s narrative. Akomfrah’s interest in the formal texture of filmmaking, as much as its social and political message, was honed not least during his years as a member of the Black Audio Film Collective (with former members David Lawson and Lina Gopaul still working alongside him). The Independent thought the Pavilion was ‘a visual feast, exploring the best and worst of our country at a time when the notion of British identity has never been so contested’.",

While her videos, performances and, most recently, virtual reality works continue to speak to technological progress and the transformation of China, it is the human experience in all of this that fascinates her the most – and has led to her staying power. ‘I come from the pre-internet era,’ she has said, ‘and what moves me is the relationship formed through emotions, people, objects and the world, not only algorithms and data.’ It is this broadness in her curiosity that registers with audiences, not least those visiting the Lenbachhaus in Munich, where her work explored the relationship between digital culture and the real and virtual worlds. The artist also had solo exhibitions at SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (where the artist transformed the galleries into, for example, a Beijing cinema foyer and a yum cha restaurant, with the help of Hong Kong-based Beau Architects) and Museum of Art Pudong in Shanghai, the last being Cao’s largest to date.",

But Preciado remains, as ever, the intellectual face for the instabilities of gender and biopolitics, and a world that’s in transition. Often cited by artists, Preciado’s work made its way into the Spanish Pavilion [https://artreview.com/venice-biennale-2024-a-guide-to-the-giardini/#:~:text=dense%20and%20captivating-,Spain%20Pavilion,-presents%20hundreds%20of] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] this year, where Sandra Gamarra [https://artreview.com/sandra-gamarra-heshiki-on-representing-spain-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] took a sentence from a lecture by the thinker to accompany a work she had made: ‘trans body is to normative heterosexuality what Palestine is to the West: a colony whose extension and form is perpetuated only through violence’.",

After the pain of her opioid addiction, and the crusade to bring down the Sackler family (museum patrons who made their fortune through the prescription opioid Oxycontin), the photographer was rewarded with a campaign for the fashion brand (an emotional moment, apparently, featuring the likes of Debbie Harry). Alongside her first big-bucks commercial deal was a show of older work presented by Gagosian at the Welsh Chapel in London, while her dealer’s New York space premiered two of her newest moving image works: the apocalyptic You never did anything wrong, in which the models are all animals, and Stendhal Syndrome (both 2024), which pairs personal photographs with portraits of masterpieces from famous museums (now devoid of Sackler sponsorship, naturally). Does this represent a mellowing? Not at all: in October Goldin was arrested outside the New York Stock Exchange [https://artreview.com/nan-goldin-among-artists-arrested-at-jewish-voice-for-peace-action/] while protesting Israel’s bombardment of Palestine.",

This year found the 2020 MacArthur genius-grant awardee taking time out from lecturing on performance studies at NYU (as well as his fellowship at Harvard and other-coast gig at UC Riverside) to lecture on subjects including the poetics of W.E.B. Du Bois and to participate in the Harvard conference ‘Jews and Black Theory: Conceptualizing Otherness’. (In a report on the latter, his performance-inflected keynote was described as a talk that ‘defies summarizing’.) But Moten, who has historically collaborated with artists such as Wu Tsang [https://artreview.com/artist/wu-tsang/], is himself as much a creative maker as a parser of ideas. In 2024, in addition to giving onstage poetry readings (he’s now published ten books of verse), he released and gigged the blacksmiths, the flowers, his second album alongside jazz rhythm section Brandon López and Gerald Cleaver, with Moten – who else – taking care of the words.",

During his leadership at Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, which commenced in January 2023, Ndikung has had to accommodate the institution’s commitment to artists of the Global South, where support for Palestine is high, while being alert to the pro-Israel stance of much of the local audience and media. In November last year, pro-Palestine protesters hung a banner at the entrance to the institution, and in April they interrupted a conference titled ‘Remembering Colonialism’. In the exhibition halls, the Euro 2024 football tournament provided a structure for the museum to reflect on migration, gender and racism in sport. The announcement then that Ndikung will curate the 2025 Bienal de São Paulo [https://artreview.com/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung-to-curate-the-36th-bienal-de-sao-paulo/] under the title Not All Travellers Walk Roads – Of Humanity as Practice offered a welcome relief, with a series of precursor research conferences already underway in Morocco and Guadeloupe.",

This staple object, used by the artist for nearly 20 years, framed a videowork in which she revisits the abandoned house that served as the venue for her first solo exhibition in South Korea in 2006. Featuring an installation formed from drying racks, origami pieces and light fixtures, that historic – and self-initiated – show set the tone for a career in which the architectural detritus of the everyday has been used to poetically reference art historical moments, political events or folk rituals. The Hayward exhibition garnered a one-star review in The Guardian but plenty of praise elsewhere: Yang’s fans are legion, demonstrated by the fact that the London exhibition wasn’t her only museum outing this year. She received a survey show, titled Flat Works, of collages, prints and paintings spanning two decades at the Arts Club of Chicago, and was included in the Lahore Biennale as well as group exhibitions at Secession, Vienna, and MoMA, New York, among others.",

It’s taken 40 years, but now Marshall’s influence can be felt globally, with Black figuration a dominant genre of current times. Consequently Marshall’s work can be found at any given time in a group show acknowledging Black artmaking: this year there was Project a Black Planet: The Art and Culture of Panafrica at Art Institute of Chicago; The Time is Always Now: Artists Reframe the Black Figure [https://artreview.com/the-time-is-always-now-artists-reframe-the-black-figure-national-portrait-gallery-london-review/] at National Portrait Gallery, London (travelling to The Box, Plymouth; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and the North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh); and Entangled Pasts, 1768–now: Art, Colonialism and Change at the Royal Academy, London (at which he showed Scipio Moorhead, Portrait of Himself, 1776, 2007, a refiguring of the eponymous, enslaved African-American artist into art history). Marshall’s participation in this last is a prelude to a solo exhibition at the institution next year.",

Those visitors (half of whom are tourists from mainland China; 30 percent are locals) make M+ more popular than Florence’s Uffizi Galleries and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, The Art Newspaper reported. Those who made it into the galleries would have enjoyed chief curator Chong’s programme, which included the first extensive retrospective of architect I.M. Pei [https://artreview.com/red-flags-in-hong-kong-art-scene-report-ilaria-maria-sala/#:~:text=seven%20decades%20of-,I.M.%20Pei%E2%80%99s,-architecture%20%E2%80%93%20although%20Pei], as well as shows celebrating Lee Mingwei, Zhang Peili, Haegue Yang and Apichatpong Weerasethakul [https://artreview.com/artist/apichatpong-weerasethakul/?year=2023], whose seminal video installation Primitive (2009) was shown in Hong Kong [https://artreview.com/the-top-exhibitions-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/#:~:text=through%209%20June-,Apichatpong%20Weerasethakul,-%2C%20M%2B] for the first time.

A Woman You Thought You Knew, which brought together works from the Kadist collection, was staged at the nonprofit’s gallery in San Francisco, while its Paris gallery boasted a programme that featured an evening of performances inspired by medieval French poetry, Manthia Diawara and Hoor Al Qasimi [https://artreview.com/artist/sheikha-hoor-al-qasimi/?year=2023] in conversation, and a group show of Ukrainian artists in collaboration with the Palais de Tokyo. Partech Africa is the largest fund dedicated to African startups, and Kadist has been increasingly present on the continent. It supported the annual exhibition Dig Where You Stand, which this year took place in two cities in Benin (Cotonou and Ouidah), and in November staged a festival at Fondation H in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.",

Lee’s approach, which has focused on organising prominent international exhibitions, including collateral shows at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], made their name – as well as her own. Now that Seoul has become a major node in the art market, Lee, whose gallery was founded in 1982 and represents approximately 50 artists, including Haegue Yang and the newly signed eighty-nine-year-old sculptor Kim Yun Shin (featured in this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/]), is more ambivalent about how helpful artworld hype can be. ‘I think we should not be “too excited” about the Korean art scene being globally recognized, becoming another art hub in Asia… Both galleries and artists should stay on their toes,’ she warned The Korea Herald. Now a family affair, with Lee’s children involved, Kukje is no doubt in it for the long haul.",

Cheng said his resignation permits him more time for public service, which includes chairing the Hong Kong government’s Mega Arts and Cultural Events Committee, responsible for providing incentives to major international events (such as Art Basel’s HK edition), and the various museum boards he attends, including New York’s MoMA PS1 and the Met, Paris’s Centre Pompidou and London’s Tate and Royal Academy of Arts.",

At least in part, the growing mightiness of the African artworld is down to the curator’s own efforts. As the director of Cape Town’s Zeitz MOCAA since 2019, and having established her name through the RAW Material Company in Senegal, Kouoh has become a leading light at home and abroad. Current shows at the institution include solos for Ghanaian-American artist Rita Mawuena Benissan [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-november-2024/#:~:text=Rita%20Mawuena%20Benissan] and South African Nolan Oswald Dennis. Earlier this year, Kunstmuseum Basel opened When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting [https://artreview.com/a-century-of-black-figuration-in-painting-review/], a survey exhibition curated by Kouoh that debuted at Zeitz. Not that it has all been plain sailing: in June, the artist Tracey Rose lambasted Kouoh and Kunstmuseum Bern, claiming that a work about Palestine had been censored [https://artreview.com/kunstmuseum-bern-hosting-tracey-rose-retrospective-branded-despicable-by-artist/] in her solo show at the Swiss institution, curated by Kouoh. Earlier this year, Kouoh oversaw Zeitz MOCAA’s annual gala, the proceeds of which help fund its educational and curatorial programming.",

There was an established market and the contemporary artists we were working with weren’t part of that,” industrialist Rajeeb told the same audience. Given the considerable number of local and international institutions now affiliating themselves with the Samdanis’ initiative, as well as visitor numbers reaching almost half a million for the sixth edition, in 2023, there is clearly more enthusiasm at this stage. The biennial summit may be skipping a year (the seventh edition will open in 2026), but such momentum has led the couple to envision Srihatta, the 40-hectare art centre and sculpture park they are building in Sylhet, scheduled to open in 2025. There are also various advisory and museum patrons’ committees to keep them busy, including Tate, Alserkal Avenue and Asia Society.\n\n*Last Year 96 (with Diana Campbell [https://artreview.com/artist/nadia-rajeeb-samdani-diana-campbell-betancourt/?year=2020])",

The Financial Times agreed: ‘Pedrosa’s thoughtful, serious approach showcases the joys and opportunities, as well as the trauma, of displacement and marvellously balances aesthetic pleasure and politics.’ Yet opinion was far from unanimous: the works on show, The Art Newspaper thought, ‘measured by technical rather [than] representative properties, are, frankly, ropey’; Folha de S.Paulo complained that Pedrosa ‘reduced the artists to slogans’. Pedrosa’s interest in identity will be familiar to visitors of Museu de Arte de São Paulo, where he is director (with an extension into neighbouring premises opening in March), where he uses a different theme every year to programme. This year ‘LGBTQIA+ diversity stories’ encompassed solo shows of work by Francis Bacon, Catherine Opie and Leonilson.",

Aside from generating a thriving local arts scene, Tohmé has become an expert at building networks across the Middle East, North Africa and beyond – an invaluable mission in a country struck by ongoing conflict. In addition to its exhibition programme (including a major show of Simone Fattal’s drawings in 2024) and free educational programmes for artists (workshops this year were led by the likes of Haig Aivazian, Marwa Arsanios and Joe Namy), the organisation ran a series of artist-film screenings at Beirut’s Sursock Museum. It was also one of the venues for ‘Why Germany’, an international lecture series reflecting on the recent crackdown on free speech in that country, for which it invited writer and academic Yasmeen Daher to consider the evolution of the Palestine solidarity movement. Tohmé’s skills as a cultural organiser are likely to have played a part in her recent appointment as director of the next Istanbul Biennial [https://artreview.com/christine-tohme-to-curate-18th-istanbul-biennial/].",

During his close-to-40-year engagement with what has been characterised as relational aesthetics, the Thai artist has become known for his participatory events, from cooking pad thai for gallery goers to providing them with ping-pong tables. You’d think it might be tricky to encapsulate such a career in a retrospective, but his MoMA PS1 survey, which closed in March, before moving to LUMA Arles in June, had a go, as did a second retrospective at Gropius Bau, Berlin, which opened in September, serving curry and Turkish coffees, and providing hangout spaces where the interactions are the work.\n\nGiven the social aspect of his practice, it is unsurprising that Tiravanija hasn’t hidden himself away in his studio: he has also established himself as a consummate curator. Building on his curating of the triennial Okayama Art Summit in 2022 and cocurating of the Thailand Biennale in 2023 [https://artreview.com/thailand-biennale-2023-the-open-world-chiang-rai-review/], he oversaw this year’s edition of Art Spectrum, a biennial exhibition featuring the next generation of Asian artists, including Heecheon Kim [https://artreview.com/heecheon-kim-keeping-it-real/], Riar Rizaldi [https://artreview.com/riar-rizaldis-theory-of-many-worlds/] and Vivien Zhang, which was held at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul. You might see the last, which was as diverse as it was intriguing, as an extension of the artist’s ongoing teaching activities (at Columbia University, New York) and his support of Gallery Ver, a commercial gallery space in his native Thailand. One thing’s for sure though, Tiravanija is as open and generous to other artists as he is to those who attend and at times become a part of his exhibitions; even if repetitive, it is effective, offering a form of openness that feels increasingly relevant to artists, given the fractious nature of our current times. Amidst everything else, Tiravanija also found time to contribute two new works to this year’s Forest Festival [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-september-2024/#:~:text=of%20Arata%20Isozaki-,Forest%20Festival%20of%20the%20Arts%20Okayama,-Various%20venues%2C%20Okayama] in Okayama (which included a series of textile works and ceramic bowls, offering visitors a lunchbox filled with locally sourced ingredients), an exhibition in Montreal, where he hosted a rehearsal space for local bands, as well as a roomsize installation at Pilar Corrias in London, just in time for Frieze Week.",

And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

As the former member of the Italian Communist Party told Vogue this year, family takes up another third, while the rest of her time is devoted to ‘culture and the Fondazione’. The Venice-and-Milan-based private institution is no trinket (with Tokyo and Shanghai project spaces), and Prada is very hands-on, telling Vogue how she struggled to find a curator who would fully embrace her vision of a future show on feminism. She did, however, get the likes of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler to curate Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Technology and Power, 1500–2025, a Marx-tinged show on tech and power that closed in January; while Meriem Bennani installed a solo exhibition in Milan, Christoph Büchel [https://artreview.com/christoph-buchel-monte-di-pieta-fondazione-prada-venice-biennale/] in Venice, Michaël Borremans in China and Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin in Japan.",

Last year Sandretto Re Rebaudengo was named president of Fondazione Arte CRT, which supplies loans and new work to the Turin Civic Gallery (GAM) and Castello di Rivoli, as well as site-specific commissions for OGR Torino, and has since doubled the foundation’s annual acquisitions budget to €1m. The patron, whose Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo has amassed a collection of more than 1,500 artworks, has long had exhibition spaces in Turin and neighbouring Guarene, but in recent years she’s been expanding her reach: she’s turning a Venetian island into an art centre (set to open next year), and the Madrid wing of the Fondazione is now homing in on a permanent HQ. Sandretto also sits on committees at New York’s MoMA, New Museum and CCS Bard, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, London’s Tate Modern, Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum and Barcelona’s Fundación MACBA, among others. At her eponymous Turin foundation meanwhile, she gave solo shows to The Otolith Group, Stefanie Heinze and Bekhbaatar Enkhtur.",

The advancement added another asset to his portfolio: the STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery. Three months later, a partnership deal was announced between NGS, where 70 percent of the collection is dedicated to Singaporean artists and 30 percent to Southeast Asian artists, and the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts to encourage loans, research partnerships and residency programmes. The 2024 exhibitions programme at NGS featured a retrospective of Kim Lim and shows for Cheong Soo Pieng, pioneer of the Nanyang art style, and centenarian Lim Tze Peng, Singapore’s oldest living and active artist. Meanwhile, Pratchaya Phinthong and Yee I-Lann received shows at SAM which also supported the organisation of Robert Zhao Renhui’s Singaporean Pavilion [https://artreview.com/robert-zhao-renhui-on-representing-singapore-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] (NGS also made a substantial loan of eight works to the Biennale’s International Pavilion [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/], curated by Adriano Pedrosa [https://artreview.com/artist/adriano-pedrosa/?year=2023]).",

It is not just the high profile at home that marks out the gallery, but the global network that its geographically-diverse artist roster has firmly infiltrated. Wilfredo Prieto represented Cuba at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], while WangShui, Bárbara Sánchez-Kane [https://artreview.com/barbara-sanchez-kane-new-lexicons-for-embodiment-kurimanzutto-new-york-review/] and Ana Segovia were in the main show; Haegue Yang [https://artreview.com/artist/haegue-yang/?year=2018] showed in London and Chicago; Minerva Cuevas exhibited at CC Foundation, Shanghai; and the gallery worked with peers Shibunkaku for a presentation at Art Collaborations Kyoto. Kurimanzutto’s satellite space in New York gives them clout there, too: this year, the Met installed specially commissioned architectural interventions by Nairy Baghramian and Petrit Halilaj, and in February the gallery announced the representation of the estate of the late New York icon John Giorno.",

The artist had removed her work from Documenta in 2022 [https://artreview.com/hito-steyerl-says-she-has-no-faith-in-documenta-tackling-antisemitism/] due to what she perceived as inaction by its curators over antisemitism, and was scathing of many of her peers who had publicly criticised Israel, telling The Guardian that many were merely practising ‘art as social media performance’. Furthermore, she bemoaned that it was those who only condemn violence on one side ‘that dominate the debate’. Steyerl’s engagement with the conflict comes as no surprise: questions of power, violence and mediation have been her subject matter for two decades now, parlayed into her video essays and multimedia installations. This year she premiered three new works that take the Nord Stream oil pipeline system as their subject at the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, and settled into her new role as professor in Emergent Digital Media at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

          "content": "Artist, curator, institutional director – Al Qasimi can claim to belong to nearly every constituent sector of the artworld (albeit these days she’s not really that well known for her painting). Plus, in the real world, she’s royalty. And yet, in recent years she has leveraged her expertise and knowledge of art from the Gulf region and further afield, to operate in geographies beyond the Emirate and areas in which she can absolutely rely on royal privilege. An exhibition of paintings she curated by the senior Māori artist Emily Karaka, which opened this autumn at the Sharjah Art Foundation, of which she is also president and founding director, may be indicative of the direction planned for the 2026 Biennale of Sydney [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-lead-the-2026-biennale-of-sydney/]. Al Qasimi was this year appointed curator of the Australian survey, which she will work on while developing her plans for the 2025 Aichi Triennale [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-direct-aichi-triennale-2025/] in Japan, of which she is artistic director (the first non-Japanese person to occupy the position, although she speaks the language, having studied there). Having previously curated the Lahore Biennale (in 2020) and the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Al Qasimi is in demand, and her global presence is reflected in her home institution’s programming, which, in addition to Karaka, has featured survey exhibitions of South African multimedia icon William Kentridge, Brazilian painter Antonio Dias and Pakistani artist and Women’s Action Forum cofounder Lala Rukh, not to mention the annual March Meeting [https://artreview.com/the-top-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-march-2024/#:~:text=March%20Meeting%202024%3A%20Tawashujat] conference. Next February marks the opening of the 16th Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/] (Al Qasimi curated the 2023 edition [https://artreview.com/artists-for-2023-sharjah-biennial-revealed/], developing a programme initiated by the late Okwui Enwezor, having been involved with the event – as director – since 2003, when she cocurated the sixth edition). For this edition, Al Qasimi has appointed an all-female team of curators [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] that includes many of the leading lights among curators operating in the context of the global majority, including Sri Lanka’s Natasha Ginwala [https://artreview.com/artist/natasha-ginwala/], Indonesian curator Alia Swastika [https://artreview.com/artist/alia-swastika/?year=2024], Bahraini-Singaporean artist Amal Khalaf, New Zealand artist Megan Tamati-Quennell and Turkish curator Zeynep Öz. Moreover, in the context of an artworld in which cancellations and boycotts are rife – coming from every direction – and generating a consequent culture of fear, Al Qasimi remains one of the few voices still prepared to use the platform art (and royal privilege) affords them in order to express their opinions directly and to keep discussions that most people allow to fade away firmly in the spotlight, whether they concern the current carnage in Palestine and Lebanon or those suffering from other conflicts across the globe. Beyond all that, Al Qasimi also serves as president of the International Biennale Association, president of the hugely influential Africa Institute in Sharjah and on the board of Ashkal Alwan in Beirut. She is also on the advisory boards of the Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi and Darat al Funun in Amman. Beyond her involvement with art, she also founded the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, and earlier this year presented a clothing collection in London which was developed from the work of her late brother, who worked in the fashion industry. But beyond her personal achievements, Al Qasimi is also a symbol of the increasing influence of the Gulf region in the spheres of finance, commerce, politics, sports and entertainment, and, of course (but perhaps primarily by virtue of the first two elements on this list) art.",

His sculpture was the focal point of a survey that opened in May at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, materially derived from dilapidated architecture and the urban realm, and specifically informed by Freedmen’s Town in Houston’s Fourth Ward. With regards to the latter, Gates is advising an initiative that plans to preserve this historic neighbourhood built and shaped by Black people following emancipation: an endeavour that’s in the mould of the socially engaged mini-empire he has been building on the South Side of Chicago since 2006. Over in Tokyo, the artist’s Afro-Mingei exhibition at the Mori Art Museum, which imagined ‘the artistic possibilities of combining Black aesthetics and Japanese craft philosophies to envision hybrid-culture futures’, laid the groundwork for incense and sake collaborations with small family-owned businesses in Japan. This mix of commerce and creativity made him an obvious choice for Prada’s diversity council, where Gates has spearheaded a mentorship programme for designers of colour.",

The issuing of the seventh edition this year was notably delayed, not once but twice, due to Russia’s invasion. In October, however, the winner was finally announced: Bangladeshi artist Ashfika Rahman, chosen from a shortlist of 21 by a big-name jury that included Cecilia Alemani [https://artreview.com/artist/cecilia-alemani/?year=2023] and Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung [https://artreview.com/artist/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung/?year=2023]. Pinchuk, who Donald Trump once called ‘a very, very special man’ (and who hired Kellyanne Conway, an official in the 45th president’s administration, as his lobbyist this year), bankrolled a vast exhibition during the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] titled From Ukraine: Dare to Dream, in which artists ranging from Shilpa Gupta to Nikita Kadan to Otobong Nkanga [https://artreview.com/artist/otobong-nkanga-2/?year=2023] reflected on what the curators described as ‘an ongoing power struggle’, while ‘storms and climate change ravage lands far and wide’ and ‘political extremes are seizing their growing momentum’. For Pinchuk, then, art undoubtedly has geopolitical purchase.",

          "content": "Following on from several years of more hard-hitting, London-focused film projects – including the 2020 Small Axe series of five films that charted the lives of West Indian immigrants to the city, codirecting the documentary Uprising (2021) on a 1981 fire in South London, and his filmic monument Grenfell [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-will-not-look-away-serpentine-gallery-london/] (2023), a single-shot circling of the site of the tragic 2017 apartment block fire – the gap between McQueen’s art and cinema projects feels wider of late. This year, McQueen received a solo exhibition that continues to occupy both Dia sites in New York, with several film works and a new photographic series on display in the institution’s Chelsea space, and in a massive former factory site Beacon is his new installation Bass, the basement space filled only with coloured lighting and reverberating with snatches of music (The music an extended jam session, recorded in-situ, between different forms of the titular instrument, played by a stellar ensemble that included Meshell Ndegeochello and jazz veteran Marcus Miller.) The show received widespread acclaim, and will travel to Switzerland’s Schaulager next year. He also released the documentary Occupied City [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-review/], in which he slowly traced and filmed all the locations that appear in author, historian and producer (and McQueen’s wife) Bianca Stigter’s book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940–1945 (2019). Offering a meditative study of the Dutch capital under the Nazis, it was a cinematic tour de force that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.\n\nSo far, so auteur. McQueen’s second celluloid outing this year, Blitz, however, which opened to mixed reviews, demonstrated how mainstream he can go. Telling the story of a young boy during the World War II bombing of London, it was ‘an old-fashioned children’s adventure movie, a rollicking yarn that might have been on television on a Bank Holiday afternoon’, thought the BBC. ‘Shockingly conventional’, Variety noted. But McQueen seems confident straddling both documentary and fiction forms, as well as arthouse and (attempted) blockbuster modes, and continues to serve as a model to artists who might want to make work that can occupy the gallery, the cinema, as well as home streaming platforms.",

Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/?year=2023] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/the-fantasy-architecture-of-julie-mehretu-palazzo-grassi-venice-review/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",

Soon to be added to this portfolio are the Lusail Museum, which will house the world’s largest collection of Orientalist paintings, and Doha’s Art Mill Museum (both slated to open in 2030), which will be ‘part global think tank and part art museum’ and feature international modern and contemporary work. The latter is already programming, co-organising Your Ghosts Are Mine: Expanded Cinemas, Amplified Voices during the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] with Mathaf and the Doha Film Institute (also under Al-Mayassa’s purview), an exhibition featuring the moving image work of 40 MENA-based artists. While in Venice, Qatar Museums signed a ‘protocol of co-operation’ to invest in Venetian heritage projects.",
