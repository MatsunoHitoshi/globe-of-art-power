            "While making eight films since 1998, six of them cityspecific and all accompanied, in Olympian postmedium style, by hyperslick, diagramlike paintings implying nested power structures, Morris has filmed, among others, Bill Clinton (in Capital, 2001) and Brad Pitt (Los Angeles, 2004). In the past year, the artist completed her most testing project yet, Beijing (2009), shot in the secretive Chinese capital during the Olympics. Emerging as a dazzlingly modern meditation on power, spectacle, architecture and smokescreens, it reaffirms that, when it comes to positioning herself where the action’s happening, Morris is contemporary art’s designated hitter.",

The past year has not been without setbacks for Nagy, and not just because India hasn’t been the new China. Bose Pacia, the New York gallery with which Nature Morte is partnered, is relocating as part of a recession-inspired regrouping. But Nagy’s Berlin, Kolkata (with Bose Pacia) and New Delhi galleries make him a key interface betweeen the Western and South Asian art scenes – a fact driven home by the crowds of people who visited his booth at India Art Summit this summer.",

With support from millions of dispossessed viewers, he has upbraided the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) for its ‘progressive’ sympathies and especially for commissioning art he considers propaganda for the Obama administration (not, perhaps, entirely without reason). The NEA has been forced to take him seriously. How long-term Beck’s interest in the arts will be is debatable.

The Berlin-based magazine Texte zur Kunst, edited and cofounded (in 1990) by Graw, has continually nailed its colours to the mast of serious, often philosophically grounded criticism, enthusiastically supported by artists’ editions. With an increasing number of English-language and online articles, the magazine is gaining ground as a serious publication of choice for aspiring academics and curators. Graw, alongside Daniel Birnbaum, set up the Institut für Kunstkritik at the Städelschule, and recently began publishing a series of considered books based on the lectures given there.",

Auction prices for his work have plummeted, and he’s being sued for alleged copyright infringements, but Prince has been on display where it matters most: at the Met, in The Pictures Generation; Gagosian Madison Avenue, in a solo show; and not least Pinault’s new Dogana space in Venice.",

In July, Saatchi announced plans to turn his gallery into ‘MoCA London’, gifting £25m of work to the UK, but the Arts Council has reportedly baulked at the condition that the gallery be able to sell from the collection to fund acquisitions.

Smith has taken a pragmatic, hopeful approach to recession trends – giving a cautious welcome to the appointment of New York gallerist Jeffrey Deitch as the new director of crisis-ridden MOCA LA, for example. In terms of art criticism, among her standout commentaries was the assertion that painting isn’t dead; she has also been taking to task the ‘squeaky-clean, well-made, intellectually decorous’ products of fashionable postminimalism and Eurokunst ‘relational aesthetics’. Mildly conservative, pluralist and suspicious of hotheaded extremes, Smith remains the Big Apple’s bastion of responsible art criticism.",

Saltz’s artworld power is a slippery thing this year, given that he’s spent much of it cultivating mass appeal – both through his appearances as a judge on the Bravo reality contest Work of Art (2010) and in the slow buildup of his Facebook and Twitter tribes. Whether this populist approach has diluted his critical standing within the industry is not yet clear: he’s certainly picked some fights in his postings – with Robert Storr (over the Guggenheim’s YouTube biennial) and Klaus Biesenbach (calling the latter ‘a dick’ for his ‘pretty boring program’) – but made a lot more friends in doing so: 3,963 at last Facebook count.",

            "The fact that there was so little comment on Maurizio Cattelan’s carte blanche to juxtapose works by an older generation of artists with his own during the Italian artist’s Menil Collection retrospective in Houston this year – Warhol and Rauschenberg included – is telling. It suggests that Cattelan will enjoy a similar durability to these artists, and this implicit esteeming may have influenced the decision by Milan’s city authorities to green-light Against Ideology (2010), a sculptural one-finger salute in the direction of the Italian Stock Exchange, sited outside Cattelan’s four-work show at the Palazzo Reale Museum this September. All of which demonstrates that the artist is of such a standing that he gets whatever he wants: dangerous territory for a notorious prankster.",

The move has seen Birnbaum shedding his previous commitments left, right and centre, resigning as rector of the influential Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main and as director of the exhibition space Portikus in the same city this April, both of which positions he’d held since 2001, as well as making an exit from the board of Manifesta, on which he’d sat since 2002. That said, he found time between CV-building to sit on various juries, including Victor Pinchuk’s Future Generation Art Prize and the inaugural Absolut Art Award, which he chaired – and which was won by Keren Cytter, a favourite of Birnbaum’s. And he remains one of the most erudite philosophers to tackle aesthetics and contemporary art practice.",

And he was briefly a significant owner of Sotheby’s stock, during which time 20 works from his collection were shown by the auction house (whatever the agreement there, when the stock rose sharply a short time later, Cohen promptly dumped it). This year, among other purchases, Cohen acquired a 1958 Jasper Johns Flag painting for a reported $110m. Still, it’s a shame when you’re so busy you can’t enjoy your own collection. He recently mentioned retiring to ‘just watch a fucking movie, or hang with my kids’. OK, he forgot to mention ‘and stare at the fucking Flag’, but we’re pretty sure he meant that, too.",

Many hopes are pinned on such regional branches, and the distinctive building – notably near the German border, designed by Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines, with a roof resembling a fallen net – is meant to beckon tourists on looks alone. It duly attracted 100,000 visitors in the first four days it was open. As well as an ongoing scheme to use vacant space at the Palais de Tokyo to show work by midcareer artists, Pacquement has announced plans for a ‘pop-up’ mobile Pompidou centre that will further the brand’s expansion. Oh, yes, and bring more art to the people. When it comes to world domination, it seems funding (currently holding up Pompidou Mobile) is the only thing standing in Pacquement’s way. That and the strikes which recently closed several of France’s leading museums for several days.",

Once they’ve pulled on their wellies, however, it turns out that Wirth and his wife, Manuela Hauser, are ready to get down with both the mud and the cultural enrichment of his new ’hood. Hauser & Wirth Somerset – a converted seventeenth-century farmhouse and grounds, featuring multiple free-to-enter galleries, outdoor artworks and a buzzy restaurant – opened in July to general artworld approval, but perhaps more importantly, with a neighbourhood-pleasing programme of talks, workshops and site-relevant residencies. How this commitment to grassroots engagement will evolve to fit the decidedly more urban terrain of downtown LA when the 9,300sqm Hauser Wirth & Schimmel opens for business next year remains to be seen.",

This year, the saga of e-flux’s bid to control the .art top-level domain extension took a new turn. Having lost out in the bidding, e-flux has partnered with the new owner, marketing .art to its extensive network. E-flux’s influence ensured that prominent institutions signed up straightaway (including the Stedelijk Museum and Para Site), with e-flux subscribers getting second dibs before the domain extension was put on wider sale.

Works from the collection are now an almost constant presence in the Benaki Museum, Athens, for instance, where this year Joannou cocurated a survey of work by the late Greek sculptor George Lappas. In June, while artist Roberto Cuoghi and his team were kiln-firing dozens of ceramic crabs as part of the artist’s Deste commission on Hydra, The Equilibrists opened at the Benaki, featuring a survey of young Greek art selected from open submission and through a hundred studio visits by New Museum curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Massimiliano Gioni. The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer – False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober – all owned by Joannou. ",

The estimated €101 million renovation of the Neue Nationalgalerie started this year, and the museum is projected to be closed for four years. Meanwhile, a new £80m, 14,700sqm modern art institution is planned for a site next door. You may be forgiven for asking whether, with all these capital projects, Kittelmann still has time to think about art. He does: projects in 2015 have included putting together an Andreas Gursky show at the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden-Baden, the Impressionism–Expressionism show at the Alte Nationalgalerie and a Mary Heilmann and David Reed show at the Hamburger Bahnhof: ‘He makes art out of other people’s art because his curatorial moves are really things that we wouldn’t have thought of,’ said Heilmann.",

            "Just as you were the settling in to read last November’s Power 100 issue, Gorvy, the chairman and international head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s auction house, saw his New York saleroom hammer down Francis Bacon’s triptych Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) for $142.4m (£88.3m), the most expensive contemporary artwork ever sold at auction. That figure, along with the current vogue among collectors for paying high prices at auction for new works by very young artists, goes perhaps a little way towards accounting for the fact that sales of contemporary art now account for close to half of all auction business. For Gorvy, it’s booming, and with new collectors flooding in there’s no sign of a bust in sight. In a market like this one, and when your auction house is top of the food chain – Christie’s had record sales of just under £800m in the first six months of 2014, a rise of 20 percent over the same period in 2013 – you’re going to have to move jobs before you’ll be off this list.",

Speaking of the move, Lévy recently stated that she ‘felt that the old, postwar pole of Paris–New York had become Berlin–Los Angeles’. Like many of the galleries that have been able to expand through the recent economic chaos, Lévy and Mnuchin (a former equities trader and director of the New York Stock Exchange) split their operation between the secondary and primary markets, with the LA space their biggest statement yet of an intention to dominate the latter in the way they already dominate the former.",

            "‘My interest is always to break down the distance between what we think [of] as art or high art and what we do in our daily life,’ Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] once told The Korea Herald. During his close-to-40-year engagement with what has been characterised as relational aesthetics, the Thai artist has become known for his participatory events, from cooking pad thai for gallery goers to providing them with ping-pong tables. You’d think it might be tricky to encapsulate such a career in a retrospective, but his MoMA PS1 survey, which closed in March, before moving to LUMA Arles in June, had a go, as did a second retrospective at Gropius Bau, Berlin, which opened in September, serving curry and Turkish coffees, and providing hangout spaces where the interactions are the work.\n\nGiven the social aspect of his practice, it is unsurprising that Tiravanija hasn’t hidden himself away in his studio: he has also established himself as a consummate curator. Building on his curating of the triennial Okayama Art Summit in 2022 and cocurating of the Thailand Biennale in 2023 [https://artreview.com/thailand-biennale-2023-the-open-world-chiang-rai-review/], he oversaw this year’s edition of Art Spectrum, a biennial exhibition featuring the next generation of Asian artists, including Heecheon Kim [https://artreview.com/heecheon-kim-keeping-it-real/], Riar Rizaldi [https://artreview.com/riar-rizaldis-theory-of-many-worlds/] and Vivien Zhang, which was held at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul. You might see the last, which was as diverse as it was intriguing, as an extension of the artist’s ongoing teaching activities (at Columbia University, New York) and his support of Gallery Ver, a commercial gallery space in his native Thailand. One thing’s for sure though, Tiravanija is as open and generous to other artists as he is to those who attend and at times become a part of his exhibitions; even if repetitive, it is effective, offering a form of openness that feels increasingly relevant to artists, given the fractious nature of our current times. Amidst everything else, Tiravanija also found time to contribute two new works to this year’s Forest Festival [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-september-2024/#:~:text=of%20Arata%20Isozaki-,Forest%20Festival%20of%20the%20Arts%20Okayama,-Various%20venues%2C%20Okayama] in Okayama (which included a series of textile works and ceramic bowls, offering visitors a lunchbox filled with locally sourced ingredients), an exhibition in Montreal, where he hosted a rehearsal space for local bands, as well as a roomsize installation at Pilar Corrias in London, just in time for Frieze Week.",

Continua’s Beijing space opened in 2005. This year, while most dealers were chasing collectors to ex-urban resorts of the rich, Continua took a punt on central Paris (as well as a popup for Anish Kapoor in Dubai). ‘There was sadness’ to the shuttered city, Fiaschi told The Art Newspaper. They opened, he added ‘to generate smiles’, first with a JR-curated exhibition pre-refurb, followed by two group shows. Still undergoing renovation is the controversially privatised Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo, where the gallery staged a small show of Cuban artists in anticipation of opening a space within the complex. Also conflicted is the trio’s operation in Cuba, which some Cuban activists have accused of legitimising the government.",

Codirectors since 2008, ex-journalist Spiegler and manager Schönholzer’s energetic leadership has seen Art Basel’s fairs consolidate their status as the go-to events for European and American collectors, combining an attractive mix of hospitality, talks and artists’ projects to smooth down the raw commercialism. And with its owners having recently acquired a majority stake in Hong Kong’s ART HK fair, Art Basel will be part of an organisation whose reach spans the globe, further concentrating the power of art fairs in the culture of the artworld. Spiegler and Schönholzer must be grinning.",

Try ‘the world’. The pair’s 30-year, dazzlingly diverse enquiry into how we interpret reality has spawned countless direct and indirect imitations internationally, though few can match Fischli/Weiss’s knife-edge balance of humour and seriousness. Institutions worldwide love them, too: at the time of writing they have overlapping retrospectives in Munich and Kanazawa. Meanwhile, a new work made for the Ludwig – excerpts from live radio edited into a single faux-broadcast that steadily baffles its listeners – suggests they’ve hardly lost their touch vis-à-vis marvelously absurdist hermeneutics.",

She has established herself as a major collector, increasingly internationally, with an eye (helped by a curatorial team) for what fits with her and husband Poju’s London-based private institution (together with a space on Broadway in New York and a residency programme on an island in Poju’s native Finland). In September Anita told The New York Times, ‘We prefer artists who like to work on longterm projects with institutions. The get-richquick painters are another story.’ So no ‘crapstraction’, then. This policy is borne out in their shows over the past year, including Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch (on now), Michael E. Smith, Adriano Costa, Heather Phillipson and, from an older generation, Albert Oehlen. Over in Finland hotshots Caragh Thuring, Sam Falls and Nicolas Deshayes holed up on the island to make work, as various vIps stopped by to take a peek.   ",

May You Live in Interesting Times was too Western-centric for some – almost a third of the artists were based in the US – but the overall critical consensus was a pretty solid ‘B’. ‘Intermittent bursts of urgency and the occasional surprise’ was the verdict of Adrian Searle in The Guardian, while Jason Farago admired the artist list in The New York Times but felt that Rugoff had nonetheless played it ‘safe’. Meanwhile, Zoé Whitley joined Rugoff’s Hayward Gallery from the Tate (and fresh off curating the British Pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale). Whatever the critics thought of Venice, Rugo can count on one fan: in June, he was awarded an OBE by the Queen.",

Mobile Homestead (2010), an ambitious public project that will see a replica of his childhood home make a journey from midtown Detroit to the suburbs where Kelley grew up, is the artist’s first public project anywhere in the world to result in a permanent installation. It’s proof of his continuing ability to remain on the perceived fringes while creating work that is undeniably significant, and which has a wide and lasting influence.",

(Given this supportive emphasis, it’s unsurprising that Philbin describes the Hammer’s primary audience as artists.) Though region-based selections may have their problems, in a period in which there are fears about the homogenisation of the LA museums (due to the growing powers of Eli Broad and MOCA), the Hammer and LAXART will help to guarantee a strong home–city scene.",

Then there will be two museums, the one dedicated to contemporary art, designed by Beirut-born Lina Ghotmeh, developed in a deal inked this year with the Pompidou (the second institution, the Museum of the Incense Road, is dedicated to ancient trading routes). Blazwick is already buying work by the likes of Yayoi Kusama, Carmen Herrera, Etel Adnan and Ibrahim El Salahi for the walls and floors. Not without controversy, Blazwick also pipped Defne Ayas to be curator [https://artreview.com/iwona-blazwick-to-curate-istanbul-biennial-2024/] of the 2024 Istanbul Biennial, against the advice [https://artreview.com/istanbul-biennial-needs-greater-transparency-now-iwona-blazwick-defne-ayas-iksv/] of the nonbinding independent selection committee (on which she originally sat).",

Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes. \n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there’s Slotover’s influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city’s East End.",

And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration – something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "Higgs could (possibly) be described as the insider’s outsider. The UK-born artist, critic and curator took over at New York’s White Columns in 2004, bringing to it (and New York) his intuitive grasp of how art can mix pop culture, subculture and every culture that doesn’t count as lifelessly institutional. So while he’s plugged in and sought after (he’s founding curatorial adviser to New York’s Independent art fair, and could place a curated section based on the life of legendary dealer Hudson at Frieze New York in May), his appreciation of the maverick reaches far from artworld epicentres – with painter Peter Doig, Higgs organised a show of the overlooked Grenada-born British painter Denzil Forrester, in the artist’s home of Cornwall. White Columns, meanwhile, ranges widely (having moved to bigger premises in April) – from a show about punk icon Richard Hell to shows by artists who live with mental illness and disability. ",

Which means numerous exhibitions: at L&M Arts in New York, Gagosian in New York, Galería Hilario Galguera in New Mexico and Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum. This last retrospective not only found Hirst partying with Albert II, the principality’s crown prince; it also included spot, spin and butterfly paintings, all series which, he announced at the Gagosian show (entitled End of an Era), he would no longer be producing.\n\nThis may to some extent slow the shrinking of Hirst’s market – down by 93 percent last year and bound to be lower this annum – and allay the artist’s detractors, who in August reiterated and expanded on accusations of plagiarism. A charge Hirst branded ‘gibberish’. Still, Hirst isn’t one for cooling his heels. His Murderme art collection grows apace, his Other Criteria publishing wing and retail outlets continue to turn out books, sell multiples and support exhibitions – and he’s rumoured to have a longterm gig booked in: a Tate retrospective to coincide with London’s 2012 Olympics. ",

Still, a routine year for Enwezor nevertheless involved Performa’s annual gala being dedicated to him; officially this was for his catalytic role in raising the visibility of South African art, though the visibility of art from all of Africa and the diaspora would, surely, be very different without Enwezor’s evangelising over the 20 years since his first major curatorial project. Meanwhile, the typically ambitious programme he oversees at Munich’s Haus der Kunst included major monographic shows (James Casebere, Michael Buthe and an upcoming one by Joana Hadjithomas & Khalil Joreige), and the whopping global survey Postwar – Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic 1945–65. In January he signed on for another five years at HDK: a no-brainer on its part, though Enwezor will no doubt pop up in many other places too. ",

Broad (together with wife Edythe) wants to be the art angel in the City of Angels, creating press and fanfare whenever he gives. And give he undeniably does.\n\nThere are fears being voiced from LA’s art community that Broad is having a significant homogenising influence on the city’s museums. Press coverage of Broad is filled with sideswipes and barely concealed irritation on the part of patrons, curators and museum directors (except those he supports or those waiting for a cheque).\n\nThe truth is, however, that museums need Broad like never before: California has a 12 percent unemployment rate and a $20b deficit, and financial cuts are being made left, right and centre. Broad, with a fortune valued at $5.7b, has pledged to give 75 percent of it away. And the building of the Broad collection museum on Grand Avenue, designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which is now getting under way in earnest, should keep him busy for the time being.",

However, Miro has come back with a major addition of her own this year, in the form of an elegant new gallery space in London’s Mayfair. And other gallery artists continue to maintain a high profile. \n\nElmgreen & Dragset’s exhibitions in 2013 have included a yearlong public project in Munich’s main squares and a major site-specific installation in the old textile galleries at the V&A in London. Meanwhile the ever-popular and populist Grayson Perry becomes the first visual artist to deliver the BBC’s annual Reith Lectures. The recent addition of Kara Walker to the gallery’s roster won’t do any harm either. ",

Bourriaud stood his ground, however, bolstered no doubt by a petition signed by almost every major contemporary artist, gallerist and curator in France, just in time to finish work on his latest curatorial opus, the current Taipei Biennial. Subtitled The Great Acceleration, it’s another showcase for Bourriaud’s restless enthusiasm for epoch-making ideas. If only art schools could be reinvented as quickly as biennials…   ",

Appointment-only tours run through the space’s second exhibition (a new group of works was hung last September, with this exhibition being a bit more low-key than the first), which features plenty of hometown talent: Klara Lidén, Wolfgang Tillmans, Michael Sailstorfer and newcomers Awst & Walther all figure large this time around. \n\nThen again, so does Ai Weiwei.

Meanwhile, Karen has been heading the VIP programmes for Art Basel’s various iterations since 2005.",

Curated by the gallerist and Francesco Bonami, the exhibition, like the architecture housing it, sought to ‘fuse elements of historicism with modernity’. Yan was the subject of a solo show at De Carlo’s second Milanese gallery in September, while fellow painter Jamian Juliano-Villani (pictures of Amy Winehouse, goats wearing Ugg boots, a dog waving a knife), took over the London space over the summer. She was followed by the more minimal, abstract canvases of McArthur Binion (who also exhibited, earlier this year, in De Carlo’s Hong Kong gallery), described by the Financial Times as ‘some of the finest and most thoughtprovoking contemporary paintings to be seen in Europe right now’.",

This vital resource for scholars and art historians, cofounded 19 years ago by Claire Hsu, now has over 80,000 records in its collections, stretching from exhibition catalogues and materials to artist’s personal archives. But it’s not all about art history for the nonprofit organisation, which also responds to the times and looks to set the agenda through talks, residencies and research that complement its ever-expanding library. In March, for example, it held an exhibition of the late Singaporean performance artist Lee Wen’s sketchbooks and plans to celebrate its 20th anniversary next year with a busy programme. One highlight of which is a collaboration with Jakarta-based educational project Gudskul for Art Basel Hong Kong.",

            "The former assistant to Joseph Beuys’s assistant, a job he got by knocking on the great artist’s studio door, has since notched up 40 years as a gallerist. He celebrated – how else? – with a show of Beuys’s works on paper at his London gallery at the start of the year, and another at Ropac’s Seoul branch at the end of the year. Having opened in Salzburg in 1983, and adding two London and two Paris spaces along the way, Ropac landed in South Korea in 2021 and this year doubled the square meterage there by adding another floor, allowing for a simultaneous exhibition of Donald Judd’s sculptures and paintings in September. As well as some of the great American estates, Ropac has become the de facto rep for canonical artists of the German-speaking world, among them VALIE EXPORT, Anselm Kiefer, Not Vital and Imi Knoebel. Georg Baselitz turned eighty-five this year, so there were more celebrations to arrange, with shows staged by the painter at nine institutions around the world, including at London’s Serpentine galleries and Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich.",

            "An art collection – and the museum that holds it – should be a portal for future generations to access our own age, López says. Whether Museo Jumex offers that is yet to be seen: 2015 was a tumultuous year that saw accusations of censorship at the newly opened museum and the departure of its inaugural director. In the absence of a replacement being named, chief curator Julieta González continues to serve as interim director. It was perhaps an odd move too for a Mexican institution to take on a Guggenheim-curated touring show on Latin American art (Pablo León de la Barra’s Under the Same Sun), and the homegrown The Natural Order of Things received mixed reviews. Hosting solo shows for Jose Dávila and Walid Raad points to a welcome direction, however, for the man who remains one of Latin America’s most important collectors. ",

For his Autumn/ Winter collection for Saint Laurent, Hedi Slimane issued an invitation and showbook featuring artwork supplied by Baldessari and centred the collection around three heavily-sequined dresses inspired by the artist’s 50-year career. Sticking to things French: the artist also unveiled a 30m-long light installation in Paris titled Your Name in Lights (2011), in which members of the public’s names are… well, you get the picture. Yet it was back home that Baldessari showed what an artworld powerhouse he is – beyond, even, the fact of his canonical art – when he, alongside peers Barbara Kruger and Catherine Opie, gave MoCA’s new director, Philippe Vergne, a vote of confidence by returning to the beleaguered museum’s board in March this year, after having left it in June 2012 in protest at the direction Jeffrey Deitch was taking the institution.  ",

However, as the head of Kaikai Kiki (the artist’s art production company), Murakami has successfully introduced his artists into the artworld. Murakami’s personal career is still flourishing: two solo gallery shows (in Hong Kong and LA) and one institutional show, Takashi in Superflat Wonderland, at Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul. His debut feature film, Jellyfish Eyes (2013), had its international premiere in April. And the Japanese makeup brand Shu Uemura has announced a cosmetics collection, titled Six Hearts Princes, based on Murakami’s 6HP anime project.",

In September the achingly hip Anne Imhof had a show in Berlin; in February Heji Shin showed her portraits of Kanye West (fresh from their outing earlier this year at Kunsthalle Zürich). The cool middle-aged people were represented there, too: an exhibition of Michael Krebber’s austere works in May ‘still managed to piss people off’, reported Artforum. But it was a dead cool person who really stole the limelight in 2019. In the early 1950s, Andy Warhol collaborated with author Ralph Thomas (‘Corkie’) Ward on a series of self-published books. The first of these, A Is an Alphabet, a collection of 26 loose pages that feature Warhol’s cute illustrations and Ward’s weird rhymes – ‘a surreal, horny fairytale’, as Interview succinctly described it – went on show in Berlin before travelling to New York.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

For to be the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art involves a lot of fundraising and a head for figures. These are likely prefixed by dollar signs and suffixed by ‘million’: the $650m needed to complete LACMA’s teardown-and-rebuild capital project; the $117.5m Govan secured from LA County in April. Or they might refer to missing square metres, after it emerged that Peter Zumthor’s design will include 10 percent less area than the planned 36,000sqm. Or be attached to the deal with Budi Tek’s Yuz Museum, with which LACMA will partner on a jointly owned foundation managing 90 percent of the Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur’s collection. Govan knows that making art accessible in California requires an unholy alliance of number crunching and celebrity: hence roping in Kanye West to donate $10m to James Turrell’s decades-awaited Roden Crater.",

Despite this, Koons remains undeterred, focusing on a series of bags being created with Louis Vuitton: a Mona Lisa backpack or a Rubens duffel, anyone?

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

Though his business includes the German art magazine Monopol and JRP Ringier, the art book publisher whose recent output ranges from the Art Basel catalogue to artist Scott King’s graphic novel, it’s not for these that our man is included here. Ringier is an avid collector and all-round art fan. More than 200 works populate the publisher’s Zürich headquarters, and artists have been commissioned to design the company’s annual report since 1997 (last year it was Laura Owens). More of Ringier’s personal collection is made available to Pool, a programme that gives an emerging curator time with both Ringier’s and Maja Hoffmann’s art. This year Arthur Fink was the appointed fellow, staging a show at Luma / Westbau, Zürich.",

By contrast, London sales throughout the year proved strong, if not earth-shattering, but for Westphal – chairman of contemporary art Europe – the auction game may be changing anyway: in October, Sotheby’s expanded its S/2 private sales gallery format from New York to London, effectively muscling in on the business of gallerists and private dealers.\n\nPrivate sales are a growth area for Sotheby’s, so S/2 London plans five selling shows a year. Sotheby’s shareholders seem to like it: the company’s shares have risen continuously, even while billionaire activist investor Dan Loeb has recently been gunning for Sotheby’s CEO William Ruprecht to step down.",

Back at the two Glasgow spaces Webster calls home, an exhibition exchange with Standard in Oslo was announced. The Modern Institute will reciprocate in due course, before planning subsequent exchanges with other international galleries. \n\nWith its stable of artists largely consisting of the gallerist’s generational peers – Simon Starling (whose epic CGI video commission has been on show at Tate Britain all year), Urs Fischer (everywhere), Jim Lambie and Cathy Wilkes among them – Webster’s gallery is small enough to be able to instigate such deft manoeuvres, but big enough and respected enough to have the endeavour noticed and cheered on.",

A tricky moment arrived when over 100 artists and intellectuals, including Lucy Lippard and Walid Raad, signed a petition calling for artists to withdraw from ‘Living as Form’, a Creative Time exhibition put together by the organisation’s influential chief curator, Nato Thompson, which toured to the Technion in Israel, a university and research centre connected to military technologies then being used to bomb Palestine. Black Radical Brooklyn, four projects set around Weeksville, a community centre in Brooklyn, met with a warm reception, however, highlighting an important history while creating artist-led community projects.  ",

King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‘Artists… like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.’ His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who’s who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks’s skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive. ",

            "Back in 2005 the collector and philanthropist declared, ‘I don’t want to be in-name-only for committees’. Nine years later there is more than enough evidence to suggest she stands by this vow. ‘Aggie’ Gund doesn’t just dash into MoMA once in a while to fulfil her role as its president emerita or as chairman of MoMA PS1; she gets involved. In September she even appeared on PS1 director Klaus Biensenbach’s Instagram feed doing stretches in preparation for a rehearsal of a Xavier Le Roy performance (the artist currently has a show at PS1). Besides MoMA, Gund chairs the Mayor of New York’s Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, is founder of the Studio in a School Association, is on the board of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and is honorary trustee of Independent Curators International and, in her hometown of Cleveland, of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art. She collects, she donates, she’s irrepressible. ",

            "In 2017 the artist worked on a concert with New Order; this year a documentary film of the collaboration was released alongside a live album. Times change, but Gillick keeps his eye trained on the intersection of aesthetics and capital, as he has done for the past two decades. While his output ranges from architectural installation to sculpture, his videoworks took centre stage at the Madre Museum in Naples this summer. If his work affects the corporate aesthetic – his exhibition at Maureen Paley, London, in September consisted of slick architectural interventions and more films – then visitors to Kunsthalle Wien in July would have been reassured that Gillick puts his heart and soul into his work, as they witnessed the production of a feature film he is making with Austrian collective Gelitin. He is equally influential behind closed doors, sitting on the steering committee of Maja Hoffmann’s Luma Foundation. With such consistent success, Gillick’s blue Mondays should be few and far between.",

The issuing of the seventh edition this year was notably delayed, not once but twice, due to Russia’s invasion. In October, however, the winner was finally announced: Bangladeshi artist Ashfika Rahman, chosen from a shortlist of 21 by a big-name jury that included Cecilia Alemani [https://artreview.com/artist/cecilia-alemani/] and Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung [https://artreview.com/artist/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung/]. Pinchuk, who Donald Trump once called ‘a very, very special man’ (and who hired Kellyanne Conway, an official in the 45th president’s administration, as his lobbyist this year), bankrolled a vast exhibition during the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] titled From Ukraine: Dare to Dream, in which artists ranging from Shilpa Gupta to Nikita Kadan to Otobong Nkanga [https://artreview.com/artist/otobong-nkanga-2/] reflected on what the curators described as ‘an ongoing power struggle’, while ‘storms and climate change ravage lands far and wide’ and ‘political extremes are seizing their growing momentum’. For Pinchuk, then, art undoubtedly has geopolitical purchase.",

This emphatically titled exhibition – near double the size of the artist’s 2013 MoMA retrospective – came courtesy of Beatrix Ruf last December, a year after taking the helm of Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum. Long a champion of Genzken’s, this was the show in which the curator nailed her colours to the mast of that venerable institution. This April the show travelled to Berlin amid much homecoming fanfare. New York’s not forgotten Genzken quite yet, though: over the summer the artist’s nine-metre-high Two Orchids blossomed in Central Park. As for her influence on the coming generation? A quick spin around this year’s Turner Prize nominees turns up enigmatic assemblages, animistic concrete forms, urban detritus, weird clothing, New York pop culture – Genzken everywhere, in other words, peeping around the edges.  ",

Nor is Brown likely to mope: he had four artists in the international exhibition at the Venice Biennale – Ed Atkins, Frida Orupabo, Avery Singer and Golden Lion winner Arthur Jafa – with Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys representing Belgium. There were also shows for Alex Katz and Ella Kruglyanskaya in his Harlem space and Charlemagne Palestine and Laura Owens at his Rome outpost, while Karl Holmqvist joined the restaurant/gallery that Brown and Rirkrit Tiravanija run in upstate New York.

            "‘We want to be as precise as possible,’ Sprüth told The New York Times Style Magazine last December. ‘We don’t want to be the biggest supermarket of art.’ It is the consistency of the duo’s artistic vision that has made their gallery – with spaces in Berlin, London, New York and Los Angeles – so economically resilient and culturally iconic. Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

After 46 years, Lisson is still an artworld cuckoo in the unhipsterish nest of Edgware Road, but this unlikely ’hood is the London home to Nicholas Logsdail’s multigenerational family of artists. This last year, weapon-mangling Pedro Reyes and claymation heroes Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg have also been welcomed into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile Lisson’s senior artists continue to assert themselves on a global scale – Ai Weiwei and Anish Kapoor have had significant international exhibitions and Marina Abramović has been, well, everywhere. After opening its first international space in Milan two years ago, Lisson recently set up a by-appointment office in New York: rumour has it that a full stateside gallery is soon to follow.",

As chairman and CEO of luxury group LVMH, a little bit of his Bloomberg-estimated $97.3bn fortune goes to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. This year the private museum gave over its galleries to Gilbert & George, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Courtauld’s hallowed collection of Impressionism. The foundation’s smaller ‘espaces’ in Venice and Tokyo, meanwhile, hosted shows by Philippe Parreno and Christian Boltanski respectively. Yet it was an even more spectacular brand of philanthropy that put Arnault and his family in the spotlight this year, after they publicly announced a €200m donation to Notre-Dame while the cathedral was still smouldering (conveniently overshadowing the €100m earlier pledged by his nemesis François Pinault). Sceptics suggested that Arnault would benefit from a tax break (he says not), and sniping over this and other megadonations was only partially quelled when, in September, they were eventually signed off.",

This last was Robert Colescott, whose paintings, which Blum & Poe hung at their Los Angeles gallery in March, combined surrealism with satire to comment on the state of race politics. Also joining the gallery was young West Coaster Mimi Lauter, who had a show in May, Chicago-based Tony Lewis, Brazilian Solange Pessoa and Japan’s Tomoo Gokita. The gallery has had a presence in Gokita’s hometown of Tokyo since 2014, and it was there, in June, that it showed Agnès Varda. The New Wave filmmaker is undergoing something of a renaissance (and, in collaborations with JR, being embraced by the artworld). That the boys are championing an older artist proves something of a theme: they also gave octogenarian sculptor Wendell Dayton his first major solo show.",

Then again, the collector (and MoMA board member) whose donations to the museum between 1997 and 2016 form this sweeping survey of Latin American art, Sur moderno: Journeys of Abstraction – The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift, is hardly your ordinary buyer. Her holdings, concentrating on art from Latin America, are constantly on loan, as well as increasingly being gifted directly to institutions. For example, the Reina Sofía in Madrid was given 45 works by 33 artists (all made since 1990) in March from the Phelps de Cisneros collection, a bequest that followed another donation of 202 works in January to Reína Sofia, MoMA and five other international museums. Hers is a name worth remembering for independent curators and scholars, too: Phelps de Cisneros is the purse behind various residencies and research fellowships, including the Independent Curators International’s annual travel grant.",

Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

She ‘drafts’ shows like a draughtswoman, she says; ‘you curate pork to make prosciutto’. Either way, there was no filler this year at Turin’s Castello di Rivoli, of which she is director, and Cerruti Villa, which put its $600m collection of modern art on display for the first time. The former hosted exhibitions by artist Michael Rakowitz and Anri Sala. Yet the bulk of Christov-Bakargiev’s energy has this year been devoted to preparing the Cerruti collection – amassed by entrepreneur Francesco Federico Cerruti from the late 1960s to 2014 – for its big public reveal in April.

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

At the end of 2018, the forthcoming Whitney Biennial – at the museum he’s directed since 2003 – became a flashpoint for controversy when employees demanded the removal of board member Warren B. Kanders over his involvement with teargas manufacturer Safariland. This after the 2017 biennial had been embroiled in a war of words over its inclusion of a painting accused of sensationalising racist violence. This time around, Weinberg dithered, artists quit the biennial and Kanders eventually resigned. One sensed damage-control when, in September, the institution broke ground on David Hammons’s monumental public project Day’s End and Weinberg described the installation as representing ‘our commitment to community and civic good’. Meanwhile, the Whitney continued to settle into its downtown home, with a big Warhol retrospective and an emphasis on shows for artists of colour (Pope.L, Kevin Beasley, Derek Fordjour). How much reputational damage the biennial hullabaloo has caused in the long term remains to be seen.",

            "As any Richter historian will tell you: trying to pinpoint a sense of style to the artist’s work is a task doomed to failure. For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter’s subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‘signature’ aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‘cult of personality’ he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‘It’s a frightening development,’ he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales – Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m – it’s been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman’s New York space in May). But his influence on painting globally remains big.  ",

She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

            "‘While I agree that there have been great strides in making things better, we still have a ways to go before there’s real parity,’ wrote Sherman as part of an online debate on sexism in the artworld earlier this year. ‘I am well aware that my prices aren’t anywhere near those of my male counterparts, and while it annoys the hell out of me, I also think, How can I complain when I’m still doing so well?’ Well, quite. By any yardstick, Sherman is pretty close to the top of the tree: number five this year on the major-exhibition-derived Kunstkompass rankings; number ten on the list of most expensive living American artists; number three on the list of most expensive living female artists. \n\nAuction prices are, of course, a dismal barometer of merit – so how about popular status? Sherman’s is such that one fan issued a free set of emojis, allowing Cindyphiles to communicate in her image. As for legacy, the Pictures Generation is now looked to as the spiritual forebear of the post-Internet generation as it grapples with a sea of rapidly proliferating, authorless images, the lack of disconnect between advertising and selfexpression, and the increasing commodification of self-image. Sherman has become an informal patron saint to every artist attempting to undermine the selfie or turn Instagram to her own purposes. If anyone can smash that glass ceiling, she’ll be the one to do it.",

(Her 2010 MoMA show was the most popular in the institution’s history, with 850,000 visitors, a number not quite matched by this year’s solos at Bundeskunsthalle, Bonn; Palazzo Strozzi, Florence; Sean Kelly, New York; and Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna, but boons for those spaces nonetheless.) Well get in the queue, because the performance artist’s exhibition schedule is booked to 2024. Abramović is famous enough to be lampooned by Cate Blanchett in a forthcoming Netflix comedy (‘Waiting for the Artist’, an episode of the Documentary Now! series screening next year) and attacked by an artist (a man smashed a portrait of Abramović over the artist’s head in September). Nor does the artist need to be present to make herself felt: the Marina Abramović Institute is increasingly active, staging, for example, eight performances by artists using her ‘method’ at this year’s Bangkok Art Biennale.",

A serial biennial curator, who also hops nimbly between the worlds of public institutions and private foundations, Gioni is artistic director of the Beatrice Trussardi Foundation in his native Italy and the curator of Dark Light: Realism in the Age of Post-Truth at the Aïshti Foundation in Beirut, which featured over 200 works from the collection of Tony and Elham Salamé and focused on the changing meanings of figuration in contemporary art. Proving he can also nip between the worlds of fashion and art, in Doha he is the cocurator of the current Valentino show, Forever Valentino, and, earlier this year, the Jeff Koons survey Lost in America.",

Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

While the effects of that remain to be seen, she nevertheless managed to develop a programme at the Stedelijk that navigates seamlessly between her usual focus on art’s next hot young thing and reexaminations of work by more mature practitioners, as recent shows for Jana Euler and Jordan Wolfson, but also Jean Tinguely and Ed van der Elsken, demonstrate. Furthermore, Ruf’s strength has always been her ability to operate as a meta-curator, in various advisory and panellist roles. In January, she launched the first Verbier Art Summit around the question of whether museums should consider ‘de-growth’, and she continues to be one of the core advisers\u2028to Luma Arles.",

            "It has been a turbulent 12 months since the head of the four Tate galleries took the number one spot on this list. While discontent and protest ﬁtfully surfaced from the activist-left over BP’s corporate sponsorship, in the spring it was Serota’s detractors on the right who made the most noise. The conservative press gleefully stretched for Oscar Wilde clichés when Tate lost not one but two directors in quick succession. Was it carelessness on Serota’s part? Perhaps not, but Penelope Curtis leaving Tate Britain for Calouste Gulbenkian Museum after a much maligned ﬁve-year tenure, and Chris Dercon announcing his decision to jump ship from Tate Modern to direct Berlin’s Volksbühne (although he’ll be staying in the post until next summer) was not a good look for Serota. \n\nThe ten-storey extension, which dwarfs Tate Modern’s original building like a super cruiseliner on the Venetian skyline, is proving controversial too. Currently four years behind its original opening date – during which performance spaces in the power station’s old oil tanks, opened to much hype in 2012, have sat idle as construction continues above them – the additional space is still missing £30m of funding, although Serota says he is conﬁdent this will be found before the new launch date of June 2016. Last year’s top spot came in recognition of Tate’s vast international network of global acquisitions committees and internationally active curatorial teams. No change there. Nor has all the construction dented its exhibition programme (Tanks aside) and general popularity with punters: a(nother) record – 7.9 million visits across all four sites in 2014–15, with 5.7 million alone stepping into Tate Modern. But with his legacy projects nearing completion, is the sixty-nine-year-old eyeing retirement in some pleasant corner of Southern England?.  ",

            "‘An institution is a learning system’, Obrist told Forbes this year while discussing the ‘Year of AI’ at London’s Serpentine Galleries. Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

            "For the past few years the press has been speculating on seventy-nine-year-old Larry Gagosian’s succession plans for what is regularly estimated as a business with a $1 billion annual turnover (accumulated through the sale of works by the likes of Nan Goldin [https://artreview.com/artist/nan-goldin/], Carol Bove and Richard Prince [https://artreview.com/richard-prince-clearview-ai-and-your-face-gagosian/], who each had a show this year in at least one of Gagosian’s 19 galleries around the world). There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
