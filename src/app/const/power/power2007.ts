            "Anupam Poddar is only thirty-three, but collecting is in his blood: his mother, Lekha Poddar, has major holdings of work by the older generation of Indian artists – Tyeb Mehta, Maqbool Fida Husain and Francis Newton Souza, among others – and they discuss most purchases together. Appropriately, perhaps, one of Poddar’s key acquisitions is My Mother and Me, a hut made of cow dung by artist Subodh Gupta. Next year Poddar opens India’s first foundation for the visual arts, the Devi Art Foundation, a not-for-profit space situated in a corporate office in Delhi that will showcase both his and his mother’s collections. Between them they have some 2,000 works, including Anupam’s holdings of Shilpa Gupta, Subodh Gupta, T.V. Santosh, N.S. Harsha and Ravinder Reddy, among others. The shows at Devi – three a year – will feature Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan artists as well as examining the Indian avantgarde and work by the diasporic community. Is he interested in non-Indian artists? “It is a lot of work keeping my energies focused on the region, so for the moment, no”, he says, “and I also have a hotel to run.” The family fortune comes from paper, and from a chain of hotels.",

            "Indian art is booming – Artprice recorded a 483% increase in prices between 2005 and 2006 – fuelled both by buying in India and by those outside the subcontinent. The leading artworld figure in India is the London-born entrepreneur Neville Tuli, founder of the Mumbai-based auction house Osian’s. Osian’s holds six sales a year and last year launched a $25.6 million art fund investing in contemporary Indian art, making it the largest art fund in Asia. It will soon expand to Dubai, where it will run a saleroom, film festival and archive, as well as launching a second offshore art fund. There is also CARD, Tuli’s vast archive and art collection, which comprises more than 33,000 works of classical and modern art, and thousands of items of film memorabilia and research documents, according to the indefatigable Tuli. Oh yes, and Tuli has launched the ET Art Index with the Indian Economic Times, which calculates the value of work by 51 top Indian artists according to the average cost per square inch (a method not without its detractors). Enough? No: Tuli also owns a leading Asian film festival and is establishing an arts-film-culture complex dubbed Osianama in central Mumbai.",

Before then, Lybke was operating his gallery underground, illegally showing works in his apartment due to East German restrictions on public-service work. He opened a second space in Berlin in 1992, but remained focused on Leipzig art. This was a canny decision, as interest in this school of art has since exploded: stable artists such as Neo Rauch (whose works were part of a big show this year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Tim Eitel (who recently showed at the gallery in Leipzig and previously at PaceWildenstein in New York) command solo shows as well as high prices.",

            "Like a man with a moustache atop a placated horse, the Cuban-born gallerist Javier Peres presides over a dark, brooding clan of artists – young emotive punks such as Terence Koh, Kaye Donachie and Amie Dicke – who have garnered substantial interest, particularly in New York and Los Angeles, over the past five years. Mark Titchner, whom he represents in his LA gallery, Peres Projects, was nominated for the Turner Prize last year, and the prolific Koh has been gaining critical acclaim for his romantic homoerotic performances, sculptures and photographs. In 2005 Peres opened a second space in Berlin – which showed mostly US artists and a few German ones – and throughout this summer he ran a project space in Athens (it coincided with the 1st Athens Biennial, and closes this month). Peres, as he will point out, is more than a dealer, and collaborates with his artists in gleeful, campy celebrations of all things priapic – for instance, the journal Daddy or, with Koh, the Asian Song Society (aka, ASS), a project space in New York that opened in 2006 with the exhibition Future Cock. Though his artists are enjoying what might be a career peak, especially on the biennial circuit, perhaps the future will see something new from Peres.",

            "New York gallerist Zach Feuer is one of those before-the-age-of-thirty success stories that are great to read about if you are before the age of thirty. Since his graduation from art school in 2000, the New Jersey native has opened a successful gallery in Chelsea (LFL), bought out his two partners, renamed the gallery after himself (Zach Feuer Gallery) and moved it to an even better location. He boasts partnerships in the Kantor/Feuer Gallery in LA and in London’s recently established Brown Gallery, run by his former director Kimberly Brown, and in 2002 was a co-founder of NADA, the New Art Dealers Alliance, which operates a satellite fair during Art Basel Miami Beach. Much interest focused on Feuer, naturally, is directed at his list of artists, and his stable – which includes Dana Schutz, Jules de Balincourt and Anton Henning – is as young, promising and publicityfriendly as he is. Schutz, for example, is widely discussed in New York for her reinvigoration of largescale, colour-soaked painting, and a number of Feuer’s artists showed work in the American art surveys – both Saatchi’s and the Serpentine’s – that opened in London last year. It seems only a matter of months before the ‘relative newcomer’ graduates to ‘veteran dealer’.",

            "With his high-concept, often political programming, it was perhaps not a surprise that the exhibition Nicolaus Schafhausen curated for this year’s German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale – by artist Isa Genzken – would be called Oil. The Dusseldorf-born curator has been an important figure in the European art scene for a number of years, particularly in Germany, where he was head of the Frankfurter Kunstverein from 1999 to 2005. During those years he transformed the exhibition space into a major centre for German ideas, through such shows as Neue Welt, Neu Heimat, non-places (2001–2), a trio on the subject of globalisation, and the popular deutschemalereizweitausenddrei (2003), which looked at painting’s resurgence among young German artists. In 2005 he was also one of the organisers of the important touring exhibition Populism (2005), and was last year appointed director of Witte de With in Rotterdam, succeeding Catherine David. In addition to helming the Witte de With he is presently also working with the organisation Das Loch to set up the European Kunsthalle in Cologne.",

The fifty-eight-year-old Korean, chairman of a transport company, a chain of 14 restaurants and the Arario department store, also owns the Arario Gallery in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, which, since it opened in 2002, has been dedicated to supporting the careers of the country’s emerging artists. In 2005 Kim opened a sister gallery in Beijing, which has a similar mission with respect to Chinese art. While rival gallerists may complain about Kim flexing his financial muscles to lure artists to the Arario fold, there is no doubting the seriousness of his enterprise. He is also a devoted collector of Western art, and among the several thousand works he owns is Damien Hirst’s Hymn (1996), bought in 2004 for $2 million, and Charity (2003) – the 22-foot-high, six-ton bronze based on a Spastics Society collection box. The collection, often set up as a rival to Charles Saatchi’s BritArt holdings, also includes works by Tracey Emin, Mona Hatoum, Marc Quinn, Antony Gormley and others. When he’s not shopping at White Cube, Kim (who didn’t train as an artist) makes his own works, describing his artistic persona, CI Kim, as ‘a dragonfly with dreams of chirruping like a cicada’. We couldn’t have put it better ourselves.",

Other Chinese artists have exploited the ‘big face’ genre, but none so successfully as Xiaogang, who, according to Artprice, outsold Jeff Koons at auction in 2006. In March this year, Bloodline: Three Comrades (1994) made more than $2 million at Sotheby’s New York, and in September Chapter of a New Century – Birth of the People’s Republic of China (1992) sold for $3.065m, also at Sotheby’s. Charles Saatchi has big holdings of Xiaogang’s work, which will feature in the exhibition New Chinese Art at the opening of the new Saatchi gallery in Chelsea early next year. Not everyone appreciates the series of highly similar works that Xiaogang produces, with help from assistants, in his three studios in Beijing, Sichuan and Chengdu; but as long as the market pays increasingly frenzied prices for his work, he seems happy to continue. Earlier this year PaceWildenstein announced that it would be representing Xiaogang, along with another superhot Chinese artist, Zhang Huan, in the US. An exhibition of Xiaogang’s work will be held in the gallery next spring.",

Such is the case with Ebrahim Melamed, whose 5,000-square-metre Honart art museum is slated to open in Tehran in 2008. Melamed, who was born in Iran and raised in Switzerland, has been collecting since 1995 and now owns work by Anish Kapoor, Sylvie Fleurie, Olafur Eliasson, Ugo Rondinone and fellow Iranian Shirin Neshat, among others. While Honart may showcase Melamed’s private collection, it will also bring artists from abroad to exhibit and discuss their work, creating a dialogue between Iranian artists and their foreign counterparts. Honart is located in a city of more than twelve million, with a long-standing tradition of collecting and cultural engagement, but Tehran has had little exposure to contemporary art since the Shah was deposed in 1979. Projects like Melamed’s have the potential to establish much-needed exchange between West and Middle East.",

The move set tongues wagging and was taken as yet more proof that leaders in the not-for-profit sector were increasingly gravitating towards commercial enterprises. Dennison was made director of the Guggenheim in 2005, replacing Thomas Krens (who many felt had outstayed his welcome at the helm of the museum), and her departure from the institution has been met with dismay from some – notably a critic on this list – who feel that the museum will flounder without her.

            "French collector Antoine de Galbert is the man behind one of the latest contenders in the Paris contemporary art scene, the non-profit foundation La Maison Rouge. While his own collection (of contemporary, outsider and primitive art, in addition to photography) is usually not shown, de Galbert is something of a champion of the private collector. The foundation, developed on the site of a disused factory in the district of La Bastille, is dedicated to staging contemporary exhibitions of work from other collections. Shows are organised by independent curators, though always in keeping with the forward-thinking ethos of the foundation’s founder, who previously launched a contemporary art gallery in Grenoble. This year de Galbert broke his own protocol and exhibited works from his own collection: artists shown ranged from gelitin and Hans Belmer to Yayoi Kusama and Erwin Wurm, and the foundation also recently mounted the first show in France of Japanese Neo-Dadaist Tetsumi Kudo.",

Famous for hosting lavish 700-guest dinner parties that kick-start Art Basel Miami Beach in December, the de la Cruz home, in Biscayne Bay, is a Mecca for artworld VIPs and ‘ordinary’ people alike – anyone can visit provided they have made an appointment. In 2004, the de la Cruzes launched the 10,000-square-foot Moore Space in Miami’s Design District, now a must-visit on the Art Basel Miami Beach public programme. Popular with artists and institutions (they recently donated work by John Bock, Philippe Parreno and Pierre Huyghe to Miami MoCA and Tate) the de la Cruzes have been vital to the promotion of Miami as a centre for contemporary art.\n\n",

And just like any other regular Joe – or Tom, Dick or François – Berardo opened his own museum last year, in a tourist area in the west of Lisbon. Housed within the site of the Belém Cultural Centre, which had given the space of its Exhibition Centre over to the collection, Berardo’s holdings will be on permanent view until 2016. It was a deal that took ten years to negotiate – the thorny issues raised when private collections go on view in, and in this case replace the programme of, publicly funded spaces – but it means the Portuguese public now have a world-class museum of impressively historical range: from Mondrian to Modigliani; Andy Warhol to David Hockney; de Kooning to Francis Bacon; as well as Portuguese stars such as Pedro Cabrita Reis. In return, the state will have the option to buy the collection at the end of its ten-year tenure. Museum visitors – 23,000 of whom traipsed through in the first 24 hours – seemed happy; the Belém centre director António Mega Ferreira, who resigned as president of the board the day after the opening, did not.",

In a recent real-estate controversy, Rosen tried to push through a Norman Foster-designed skyscraper on the sedate Upper East Side, with plans to includes a Kunsthallelike exhibition space. When it was blocked by a local committee, Rosen – to paraphrase The New York Times – dusted off his starry Rolodex and brought a number of art and social celebrities to testify to the project’s merit. Born in Frankfurt and married to the New York socialite Samantha Boardman, Rosen is rather less than publicity-shy, and like many men with starry rolodexes, he sees his artistic counterpart in showmen like Jeff Koons, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst – all artists represented in his collection, as are other top-tier artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Christopher Wool and Sol LeWitt. While New York contents itself with his gallery on the ground floor of the Lever House, his promised, thwarted Kunsthalle space is probably still somewhere on the cards.",

After museum shows in Montreal and San Francisco, Kiefer hit his stride this year with a major solo show at White Cube Mason’s Yard. Aperiatur Terra furthered the sixty-two-yearold artist’s interest in the symbolic and the mythological, drawing on Biblical texts alluding to the coming of Christ to produce a massive installation of painting and sculpture. Kiefer scored a simultaneous hit with the architectural sculpture Jericho, two tottering towers of reinforced concrete that dominated the courtyard of the nearby Royal Academy of Arts; allegorical echoes of the Twin Towers merging with the blasted aesthetics of countless conflict zones. Aperiatur Terra has since toured to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney. Since then, the Guggenheim Bilbao has hosted a massive six-month retrospective of Kiefer’s work, during which time he has managed to fill the atrium of Paris’s Grand Palais with an installation of truly apocalyptic proportions. This autumn sees the opening of a special commission at the Louvre. Now the question could be; can Kiefer’s work get any bigger?",

Artists whose work features in his collection include names as disparate as Vito Acconci, John Baldessari, Thomas Hirschhorn, Richard Prince, Sarah Lucas, Kara Walker and Pipilotti Rist. It is largely thanks to the interest of people like Sender that prices in the contemporary market have soared. Indeed Sender sold some of his collection at Phillips de Pury last year, against a reportedly hefty guarantee. Though there is much speculation as to what will happen to the hedge-fund buck if the art market dips, Sender’s interest precedes that of many of his peers. He is certainly seen as one of the most switched on in his field, and has said he will be buying art for years to come. At least that’s what we hope.",

As much as the size of their corporate collection – which is overseen by Alistair Hicks and comprises 50,000 works of art (Deutsche Bank collect museum-scale pieces but much of this number is in works on paper) – Deutsche Bank are known for being active sponsors of exhibitions, biennials and institutions.

In 2006 Tate showed the UBS photography collection, which includes iconic work such as Andreas Gursky’s photograph of a convenience store, 99 Cent (1999), and this past year showed its drawing collection (closing this month). The partnership follows on ones already in place in other museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, which allow the bank to share its collection with the wider public. The policy, at least in the case of Tate Modern, has raised concerns about using publicly funded gallery space to show a corporate collection, but the scheme does suggest that each museum will get at least some of the works shown.

            "Ingvild Goetz is the woman behind one of Europe’s most forward-thinking collections of new media pioneers, the Sammlung Goetz. Located in Munich since 1993 and housed in a building designed by Herzog & de Meuron, it includes a tremendous collection of film and video art by luminaries who range from heroes of the medium’s early days, such as Bruce Nauman, to today’s big names like Matthew Barney, Doug Aitken, Tony Oursler and Mike Kelley, and its impressive array of multi-channel projections and room-size installations are the fruit of Goetz’s long-term commitment to the medium. The collection is not limited to artists renowned for new media, however, and also boasts work by names like Peter Doig, Wade Guyton and Kelley Walker, Nigel Cooke and Richard Prince. Open to the public by appointment, Sammlung Goetz will be showing Matthew Barney, beginning in November",

            "Gary Garrels has kept a low profile in Los Angeles since arriving in 2005 from the Museum of Modern Art, in New York, where he was chief curator of drawings and a curator of painting and sculpture. Frustrated with aspects of MoMA’s institutional culture, he made the leap to chief curator at LA’s renowned Hammer. His professed reason for leaving an important post in New York’s most important institution is the vibrant energy in the LA scene, and at the Hammer particularly. It’s a move seen by many as another confirmation of the migration of America’s creative centre from the East to the West. And though he’s kept fairly quiet, especially compared to the Hammer’s glamorous director, Ann Philbin, his initial steps show promise: Garrels helped steer a show of drawings by the Latvian-born American artist Vija Celmins, in association with the Pompidou Centre; his first clear announcement of his take has been this summer’s Eden’s Edge: Fifteen LA Artists, an idiosyncratic show ranging from established figures like Lari Pittman and Jim Shaw to relative unknowns; and his enthusiasm for LA’s young scene, and the Hammer’s ability to work on small shows with emerging artists, looks set to make waves. What comes next for Garrels is one of the most intriguing questions of a Southern California scene that continues to expand and deepen.",

Speyer was recently appointed chairman of MoMA’s board, and the two were major donors to the museum’s expansion programme (for which they also helped the museum negotiate important land acquisitions). Farley is deeply involved with the renovation of Lincoln Center, the performing arts complex on the Upper West Side, serving on a number of its boards. As president and chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, which own some of the most important real estate in the city – Rockefeller Center, for example, and the Chrysler and Lipstick buildings – Speyer is an enormously powerful real-estate baron, and has used this clout to muscle through such works as Puppy (2000), Jeff Koons’s oversize flower dog, which was shown at Rockefeller Center in partnership with the Public Art Fund. Farley is also at Tishman Speyer; she is a senior managing director at the firm and oversees the company’s business in all emerging markets. The couple are also private collectors, and own work by Robert Rauschenberg, Christian Boltanski, Frank Stella, Koons and others.",

Momin, associate curator at the Whitney and branch director and curator of its Altria offsite space, and Chrissie Iles, who has been a curator at the Whitney since 1997, and who is widely praised for her efforts in building the museum’s collection of artists’ film.\n\nThis year’s successes at the Whitney have included emerging names such as Mark Grotjahn and Terence Koh (his first American museum show, curated by Iles), as well as stars such as Gordon Matta Clark, Edward Hopper and Rudolf Stingel (described by Roberta Smith as ‘the best-looking’ show she had ever seen at the Whitney). The next 12 months look equally good. First up is De Salvo’s retrospective of Lawrence Weiner, opening this month, while the 2008 Whitney Biennial, curated by Henriette Huldisch together with Momin, will again be one of the big events in the art calendar. With a focus on recent American art, it’s primed to send waves through every aspect of the contemporary artworld.",

He’s already changed his name (from Goldberg), driven a delivery truck, served in the US Army, made a guest appearance in an episode of The Simpsons, designed a line of jewellery for Tiffany’s, been the subject of a feature film, hung out with Brad Pitt and launched a software division, Gehry Technologies, so that architects around the world can be more like him. But the original ‘starchitect’ has never been one to sit back. During the past year he’s seen the unveiling of his first building in New York, collaborated on an exhibition with longtime friend Sophie Calle and launched his plans for the latest $200-million branch of the Guggenheim franchise in Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, work continues on Bernard Arnault’s Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation, due to open by 2010 and located in Paris’s Bois de Boulogne, which Gehry claims will ‘symbolise France’s devotion to culture’. Just as much, presumably, as it symbolises the artworld big-hitters’ continuing devotion to Gehry.",

Recent openings include branches of Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn’s Salon 94 and Chelsea gallery Lehmann Maupin. Phillips and Flood have a crack curatorial team, including Massimiliano Gioni of the Wrong Gallery, and shows of Tomma Abts and of the Rivane Neuenschwander lined up. An innovative partnership between the New Museum, the MCA Chicago and the Hammer in LA to commission and acquire new video has resulted in work by Patty Chang, Fiona Tan and Aernout Mik. Most stunning will be the museum’s new building by Japanese architects Sejima + Nishizawa/SANAAT.",

Guggenheim Foundation) has spent much of the year talking up plans for the latest branch of the great art brand in Abu Dhabi. Due to be designed by Krens favourite Frank Gehry, the museum will cost between $200 and $400 million, and, alongside a branch of the Louvre, forms a key part of the Emirate’s attempt to recreate itself as a cultural Xanadu. Much of Krens’s influence is based on the success of the other Gehry-designed Guggenheim in Bilbao (since opening in 1997 it has drawn in nine million visitors, helped create 4,200 new jobs a year, and contributed $2 billion to Spain’s GDP). ‘Business moguls, governors, mayors – they all come through the Guggenheim on a regular basis. Bilbao has had such an enormous impact,’ said Krens in a recent interview, adding fuel to the fires of those critics (of which there are legion) who think that business is mostly what Krens is now about. But perhaps this is merely the most obvious symptom of the way art institutions are going. Krens also claims that over the last three years 130 cities have made requests for Guggenheimification.",

Rabinowitz will become Artistic Director, Schönholzer will be in charge of organisation and finances, and Spiegler will be responsible for strategy and development.

The Bihar-born artist’s works reference traditional India, yet are made with the sleekest of materials: glossy oils in his paintings and gleaming stainless steel utensils in his installations. It is this mix of the sleek and down-home that makes his work such a hot ticket for high-profile collectors, who include François Pinault, Dakis Joannou and Charles Saatchi. Indeed, the value of his works sold at auction has risen from $23,000 (in May 2005) to just under $1.5 million (in June 2008), and as a measure of his success, he and wife Bharti Kher were recently signed to premier gallery Hauser & Wirth.",

With the acquisition of Art Chicago, the Toronto International Art Fair and the Armory Show in New York (which will be expanding this year into two simultaneous and adjacent fairs: Armory Contemporary and Armory Modern), Kennedy has turned Merchandise Mart into a major conduit of contemporary art commerce. This is no passing fancy, however; Kennedy started with MMPI in 1987, when he was fresh out of college, so we can assume that he sees something more in the contemporary art space than its rarefied flash.

It’s also an image supported by its very visible owner, Simon de Pury, former chairman of Sotheby’s Europe, who recently produced a compilation album, Saturday@Phillips, and brought the splashy Hip Hop’s Crown Jewels to his salerooms. His standing as an auctioneer was further underlined this summer when he was the focus of artist Julius Friedman’s film project Make It Rain, screened at Patrick Painter in LA, which pointed to de Pury as a rainmaker extraordinaire. When you consider that the company has been running for just more than a decade and is the third most successful auction house in the world, Friedman’s choice of subject seems perfectly natural.",

He’s here because he’s behind Saadiyat Island, a luxury resort featuring the world’s ‘largest single cluster of world-class cultural assets’ (including a Louvre designed by Jean Nouvel and a Guggenheim by Frank Gehry). It’s the artworld’s ultimate exercise in Disneyfication. It’s so big that earlier this year George W. Bush paid a trip to Abu Dhabi to fawn over the models personally. It’s so big that longtime Guggenheim Director Thomas Krens left his post to focus on it. ‘The only expression I can think of to describe it is pharaonic’, he said earlier this year. Not because he was geographically confused, but rather, we’re sure, to demonstrate the true internationalism of the modern museum-brand.",

Meanwhile its enormous temporary premises at the back of London’s Royal Academy (rented at a reported £4 million-plus for three years) has opened. Yet with so many new exhibitions, and ones that don’t so much open as pop up out of nowhere, the megagallery is turning into a programmatically confusing space. Though an artworld juggernaut, it’s hard to tell if anyone’s behind the wheel. Maybe that doesn’t matter: HoV will keep on truckin’ regardless.",

Throughout this crisis, MOCA’s world-beating exhibitions, including Martin Kippenberger and Marlene Dumas retrospectives, WACK! and © MURAKAMI, were touring the globe. Now breathing a little again, MOCA and Chief Curator Paul Schimmel will be focusing on home turf, with the hugely ambitious exhibition Wasteland: Art After Earth Art (including a mega-installation in the Mojave Desert by Christoph Büchel – yikes), a Jack Goldstein retrospective and a bold reappraisal of 1970s California art.",

This split personality has been on view in the artist’s exhibitions this past year, from his wrapping of the Hong Kong Museum of Art to appearing at the cool beating heart of the exhibition Sonic Youth Etc.: Sensational Fix. Auction prices for his work have plummeted, and he’s being sued for alleged copyright infringements, but Prince has been on display where it matters most: at the Met, in The Pictures Generation; Gagosian Madison Avenue, in a solo show; and not least Pinault’s new Dogana space in Venice.",

In July, Saatchi announced plans to turn his gallery into ‘MoCA London’, gifting £25m of work to the UK, but the Arts Council has reportedly baulked at the condition that the gallery be able to sell from the collection to fund acquisitions.

Smith has taken a pragmatic, hopeful approach to recession trends – giving a cautious welcome to the appointment of New York gallerist Jeffrey Deitch as the new director of crisis-ridden MOCA LA, for example. In terms of art criticism, among her standout commentaries was the assertion that painting isn’t dead; she has also been taking to task the ‘squeaky-clean, well-made, intellectually decorous’ products of fashionable postminimalism and Eurokunst ‘relational aesthetics’. Mildly conservative, pluralist and suspicious of hotheaded extremes, Smith remains the Big Apple’s bastion of responsible art criticism.",

So here you are, Jerry, comfortably nestled between Victoria Miro and the Zabludowiczes. Saltz’s artworld power is a slippery thing this year, given that he’s spent much of it cultivating mass appeal – both through his appearances as a judge on the Bravo reality contest Work of Art (2010) and in the slow buildup of his Facebook and Twitter tribes. Whether this populist approach has diluted his critical standing within the industry is not yet clear: he’s certainly picked some fights in his postings – with Robert Storr (over the Guggenheim’s YouTube biennial) and Klaus Biesenbach (calling the latter ‘a dick’ for his ‘pretty boring program’) – but made a lot more friends in doing so: 3,963 at last Facebook count.",

            "After curating the Venice Biennale to record-breaking attendance in 2009, Daniel Birnbaum has had a homecoming year: in 2010 he took up the directorship of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm and its orange-clad new outpost in Malmö. The move has seen Birnbaum shedding his previous commitments left, right and centre, resigning as rector of the influential Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main and as director of the exhibition space Portikus in the same city this April, both of which positions he’d held since 2001, as well as making an exit from the board of Manifesta, on which he’d sat since 2002. That said, he found time between CV-building to sit on various juries, including Victor Pinchuk’s Future Generation Art Prize and the inaugural Absolut Art Award, which he chaired – and which was won by Keren Cytter, a favourite of Birnbaum’s. And he remains one of the most erudite philosophers to tackle aesthetics and contemporary art practice.",

He is also one of the world’s most active art collectors. And he was briefly a significant owner of Sotheby’s stock, during which time 20 works from his collection were shown by the auction house (whatever the agreement there, when the stock rose sharply a short time later, Cohen promptly dumped it). This year, among other purchases, Cohen acquired a 1958 Jasper Johns Flag painting for a reported $110m. Still, it’s a shame when you’re so busy you can’t enjoy your own collection. He recently mentioned retiring to ‘just watch a fucking movie, or hang with my kids’. OK, he forgot to mention ‘and stare at the fucking Flag’, but we’re pretty sure he meant that, too.",

Once they’ve pulled on their wellies, however, it turns out that Wirth and his wife, Manuela Hauser, are ready to get down with both the mud and the cultural enrichment of his new ’hood. Hauser & Wirth Somerset – a converted seventeenth-century farmhouse and grounds, featuring multiple free-to-enter galleries, outdoor artworks and a buzzy restaurant – opened in July to general artworld approval, but perhaps more importantly, with a neighbourhood-pleasing programme of talks, workshops and site-relevant residencies. How this commitment to grassroots engagement will evolve to fit the decidedly more urban terrain of downtown LA when the 9,300sqm Hauser Wirth & Schimmel opens for business next year remains to be seen.",

            "‘Think the impossible’ is a central mantra down Serpentine Galleries way – one appended equally to exhibition-making and fundraising. For Peyton-Jones, this next year will be her 25th at the helm of the once-humble Hyde Park institution. Her appearance on the society pages alongside Pharrell Williams and other Serpentine partygoers has long been de rigueur, but as a finalist for the 2015 Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Award, Peyton-Jones has been explaining how annual visitor figures reached almost a million across the Serpentine’s two galleries in 2014, and how 85 percent of their £7m turnover is raised from private sources.\n\nCodirector Obrist is, as ever, ubiquitous: outlining the ‘Museum of the Future’ in Doha; touring 15 Rooms to Shanghai; winning the International Folkwang Prize in Essen. ‘In a sense Obrist is a human aggregator,’ wrote Hal Foster, reviewing Obrist’s Ways of Curating in the London Review of Books, ‘almost a social-media-in-person or a hive-mind of one.’ As might be expected, Ways of Curating is but one of 17-odd books authored or coauthored by the hyperactive uber-curator this year – and his river of published interviews and conversation is in turn cited in dozens of other publications. Obrist’s 103,000 Instagram followers chart his ceaseless travel through the location of celebrity contributors to his Post-it notes project – Orhan Pamuk in Istanbul; Olafur Eliasson in Copenhagen; Bret Easton Ellis, John Baldessari and Miranda July in LA – such that it is sometimes easy to forget his ties to an institutional ‘home’.",

Works from the collection are now an almost constant presence in the Benaki Museum, Athens, for instance, where this year Joannou cocurated a survey of work by the late Greek sculptor George Lappas. In June, while artist Roberto Cuoghi and his team were kiln-firing dozens of ceramic crabs as part of the artist’s Deste commission on Hydra, The Equilibrists opened at the Benaki, featuring a survey of young Greek art selected from open submission and through a hundred studio visits by New Museum curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Massimiliano Gioni. The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer – False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober – all owned by Joannou. ",

            "Just as you were the settling in to read last November’s Power 100 issue, Gorvy, the chairman and international head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s auction house, saw his New York saleroom hammer down Francis Bacon’s triptych Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) for $142.4m (£88.3m), the most expensive contemporary artwork ever sold at auction. That figure, along with the current vogue among collectors for paying high prices at auction for new works by very young artists, goes perhaps a little way towards accounting for the fact that sales of contemporary art now account for close to half of all auction business. For Gorvy, it’s booming, and with new collectors flooding in there’s no sign of a bust in sight. In a market like this one, and when your auction house is top of the food chain – Christie’s had record sales of just under £800m in the first six months of 2014, a rise of 20 percent over the same period in 2013 – you’re going to have to move jobs before you’ll be off this list.",

Like many of the galleries that have been able to expand through the recent economic chaos, Lévy and Mnuchin (a former equities trader and director of the New York Stock Exchange) split their operation between the secondary and primary markets, with the LA space their biggest statement yet of an intention to dominate the latter in the way they already dominate the former.",

Yet controversy shifted into crisis when it emerged late last year that the organisation had overspent by €7m, leading the Kassel branch of Germany’s far-right AfD party to sue Szymczyk and CEO Annette Kulenkampff for mismanaging public funds (they were cleared in August of any wrongdoing). That the exhibition had been politicised was confirmed in October by the removal of Olu Oguibe’s Monument to Strangers and Refugees (2017) from Kassel’s central square by the local government. Szymczyk might have been guilty of overreach, but his radical decentring of the quinquennial – twinned exhibitions complemented by expansive publishing and public programmes exploring indigeneity, antifascism, resistance, identity and marginality – provoked conversations that feel increasingly pressing. Not to mention that his recent travails reveal the upped stakes in the European culture wars. His next move is attended with interest.",

By the end of it he’d also racked up solo shows at Almine Rech in Brussels and Gagosian in Rome as well as producing a new work for the Liverpool Biennial and the Hayward Gallery’s New Décor summer show.",

            "With art ‘flippers’ hogging the media limelight, Anita Zabludowicz’s ongoing commitment to artists can be seen with new respect. She has established herself as a major collector, increasingly internationally, with an eye (helped by a curatorial team) for what fits with her and husband Poju’s London-based private institution (together with a space on Broadway in New York and a residency programme on an island in Poju’s native Finland). In September Anita told The New York Times, ‘We prefer artists who like to work on longterm projects with institutions. The get-richquick painters are another story.’ So no ‘crapstraction’, then. This policy is borne out in their shows over the past year, including Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch (on now), Michael E. Smith, Adriano Costa, Heather Phillipson and, from an older generation, Albert Oehlen. Over in Finland hotshots Caragh Thuring, Sam Falls and Nicolas Deshayes holed up on the island to make work, as various vIps stopped by to take a peek.   ",

            "Like many Chinese galleries, Shanghart had a conservative year in terms of programming. Its four spaces in Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore were closed for months due to public health restrictions. Headquartered in Shanghai, the gallery came out of hibernation ready to dominate the city’s art scene during the last quarter of 2020, with its A-listers getting an impressive airing. Xue Song showed at Powerlong Museum, Yang Zhenzhong at Rén Space, Zhang Enli at Power Station of Art, Zhu Jia at Modern Art Base and Yang Fudong at HOW Art Museum – all in the same month! But Shanghart is not all about the Chinese-Male-Artist-of-a-Certain-Age. At its own M50 space is Under the Sign of Saturn, a group show featuring three young female artists from Guangzhou – Qin Jin, Chen Dandizi and Lin Yuqi – demonstrating its commitment to supporting new voices from outside the typical centres of art production.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Mobile Homestead (2010), an ambitious public project that will see a replica of his childhood home make a journey from midtown Detroit to the suburbs where Kelley grew up, is the artist’s first public project anywhere in the world to result in a permanent installation. It’s proof of his continuing ability to remain on the perceived fringes while creating work that is undeniably significant, and which has a wide and lasting influence.",

(Given this supportive emphasis, it’s unsurprising that Philbin describes the Hammer’s primary audience as artists.) Though region-based selections may have their problems, in a period in which there are fears about the homogenisation of the LA museums (due to the growing powers of Eli Broad and MOCA), the Hammer and LAXART will help to guarantee a strong home–city scene.",

Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes. \n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there’s Slotover’s influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city’s East End.",

            "Speaking to The Korea Times during the opening of Correspondence: Lee Ufan and Mark Rothko at Pace’s Seoul branch, CEO Glimcher was in a philosophical mood. ‘Artists are creating something that’s purely of the spirit, but we’re hoping someone will actually spend money on it. And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration – something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "Few museum appointments can have produced as much debate as the hiring of longtime New York gallerist and art impresario Deitch to the top position at LA MOCA. Why the surprise? If your entire art career has been about serving the interests of a particular group of artists and a particular group of collectors, can you really acquire overnight the disinterest that most people expect a museum director to pretend to have? But as those groups include the kind of people he’ll be asking to donate money to his new institution, there’s a certain logic to it all.\n\nDeitch’s energetic presence and savvy (an attentiongrabbing collaboration with actor James Franco, for example) are probably what the ailing MOCA needs right now: nearbankrupt after financial mismanagement and the credit-crunch caught up with it, MOCA was bailed out by a $30m donation plan from billionaire MOCA trustee Eli Broad.\n\nDeitch’s appointment probably won’t appease those who worry that Broad is too dominant on the LA art scene, or the artists who wonder why this museum director is hanging out with actors instead of seeing what’s happening in their studios, but when you’re on your knees, it’s hard to be too demanding. If Deitch makes a success of this, it may become a model other museums will want to follow.",

            "In the sense that there’ve been no newspaper hogging auctions or switches of direction, Damien Hirst has had a relatively unassuming year. Which means numerous exhibitions: at L&M Arts in New York, Gagosian in New York, Galería Hilario Galguera in New Mexico and Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum. This last retrospective not only found Hirst partying with Albert II, the principality’s crown prince; it also included spot, spin and butterfly paintings, all series which, he announced at the Gagosian show (entitled End of an Era), he would no longer be producing.\n\nThis may to some extent slow the shrinking of Hirst’s market – down by 93 percent last year and bound to be lower this annum – and allay the artist’s detractors, who in August reiterated and expanded on accusations of plagiarism. A charge Hirst branded ‘gibberish’. Still, Hirst isn’t one for cooling his heels. His Murderme art collection grows apace, his Other Criteria publishing wing and retail outlets continue to turn out books, sell multiples and support exhibitions – and he’s rumoured to have a longterm gig booked in: a Tate retrospective to coincide with London’s 2012 Olympics. ",

Broad (together with wife Edythe) wants to be the art angel in the City of Angels, creating press and fanfare whenever he gives. And give he undeniably does.\n\nThere are fears being voiced from LA’s art community that Broad is having a significant homogenising influence on the city’s museums. Press coverage of Broad is filled with sideswipes and barely concealed irritation on the part of patrons, curators and museum directors (except those he supports or those waiting for a cheque).\n\nThe truth is, however, that museums need Broad like never before: California has a 12 percent unemployment rate and a $20b deficit, and financial cuts are being made left, right and centre. Broad, with a fortune valued at $5.7b, has pledged to give 75 percent of it away. And the building of the Broad collection museum on Grand Avenue, designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which is now getting under way in earnest, should keep him busy for the time being.",

And other gallery artists continue to maintain a high profile. \n\nElmgreen & Dragset’s exhibitions in 2013 have included a yearlong public project in Munich’s main squares and a major site-specific installation in the old textile galleries at the V&A in London. Meanwhile the ever-popular and populist Grayson Perry becomes the first visual artist to deliver the BBC’s annual Reith Lectures. The recent addition of Kara Walker to the gallery’s roster won’t do any harm either. ",

Whether Museo Jumex offers that is yet to be seen: 2015 was a tumultuous year that saw accusations of censorship at the newly opened museum and the departure of its inaugural director. In the absence of a replacement being named, chief curator Julieta González continues to serve as interim director. It was perhaps an odd move too for a Mexican institution to take on a Guggenheim-curated touring show on Latin American art (Pablo León de la Barra’s Under the Same Sun), and the homegrown The Natural Order of Things received mixed reviews. Hosting solo shows for Jose Dávila and Walid Raad points to a welcome direction, however, for the man who remains one of Latin America’s most important collectors. ",

For his Autumn/ Winter collection for Saint Laurent, Hedi Slimane issued an invitation and showbook featuring artwork supplied by Baldessari and centred the collection around three heavily-sequined dresses inspired by the artist’s 50-year career. Sticking to things French: the artist also unveiled a 30m-long light installation in Paris titled Your Name in Lights (2011), in which members of the public’s names are… well, you get the picture. Yet it was back home that Baldessari showed what an artworld powerhouse he is – beyond, even, the fact of his canonical art – when he, alongside peers Barbara Kruger and Catherine Opie, gave MoCA’s new director, Philippe Vergne, a vote of confidence by returning to the beleaguered museum’s board in March this year, after having left it in June 2012 in protest at the direction Jeffrey Deitch was taking the institution.  ",

However, as the head of Kaikai Kiki (the artist’s art production company), Murakami has successfully introduced his artists into the artworld. Murakami’s personal career is still flourishing: two solo gallery shows (in Hong Kong and LA) and one institutional show, Takashi in Superflat Wonderland, at Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul. His debut feature film, Jellyfish Eyes (2013), had its international premiere in April. And the Japanese makeup brand Shu Uemura has announced a cosmetics collection, titled Six Hearts Princes, based on Murakami’s 6HP anime project.",

For to be the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art involves a lot of fundraising and a head for figures. These are likely prefixed by dollar signs and suffixed by ‘million’: the $650m needed to complete LACMA’s teardown-and-rebuild capital project; the $117.5m Govan secured from LA County in April. Or they might refer to missing square metres, after it emerged that Peter Zumthor’s design will include 10 percent less area than the planned 36,000sqm. Or be attached to the deal with Budi Tek’s Yuz Museum, with which LACMA will partner on a jointly owned foundation managing 90 percent of the Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur’s collection. Govan knows that making art accessible in California requires an unholy alliance of number crunching and celebrity: hence roping in Kanye West to donate $10m to James Turrell’s decades-awaited Roden Crater.",

(Koons donated the concept, not the finished work; one critic called it a ‘poisoned chalice’.) Despite this, Koons remains undeterred, focusing on a series of bags being created with Louis Vuitton: a Mona Lisa backpack or a Rubens duffel, anyone? When it comes to an unruffled engagement with capitalism and the smoothest of productions, Koons remains king. ",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

Though his business includes the German art magazine Monopol and JRP Ringier, the art book publisher whose recent output ranges from the Art Basel catalogue to artist Scott King’s graphic novel, it’s not for these that our man is included here. Ringier is an avid collector and all-round art fan. More than 200 works populate the publisher’s Zürich headquarters, and artists have been commissioned to design the company’s annual report since 1997 (last year it was Laura Owens). More of Ringier’s personal collection is made available to Pool, a programme that gives an emerging curator time with both Ringier’s and Maja Hoffmann’s art. This year Arthur Fink was the appointed fellow, staging a show at Luma / Westbau, Zürich.",

By contrast, London sales throughout the year proved strong, if not earth-shattering, but for Westphal – chairman of contemporary art Europe – the auction game may be changing anyway: in October, Sotheby’s expanded its S/2 private sales gallery format from New York to London, effectively muscling in on the business of gallerists and private dealers.\n\nPrivate sales are a growth area for Sotheby’s, so S/2 London plans five selling shows a year. Sotheby’s shareholders seem to like it: the company’s shares have risen continuously, even while billionaire activist investor Dan Loeb has recently been gunning for Sotheby’s CEO William Ruprecht to step down.",

King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‘Artists… like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.’ His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who’s who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks’s skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive. ",

In September she even appeared on PS1 director Klaus Biensenbach’s Instagram feed doing stretches in preparation for a rehearsal of a Xavier Le Roy performance (the artist currently has a show at PS1). Besides MoMA, Gund chairs the Mayor of New York’s Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, is founder of the Studio in a School Association, is on the board of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and is honorary trustee of Independent Curators International and, in her hometown of Cleveland, of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art.

Even when the reality is a headless corpse. In 2015 his work was everywhere. His 2013 Gramsci Monument project in the Bronx was the subject of a documentary film by Angelo A. Lüdin. \n\nHis immersive installation Nachwirkung (Aftermath) opened at the Kunsthalle Bremen and his collages transformed the project room of the MAN in Nuoro, Italy. His installation in the Central Pavilion of the Venice Biennale simulated the collapse of that structure’s roof, and he brought a similarly apocalyptic scenario to the South London Gallery, complete with a quotation that takes the work back to Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci: ‘Destruction is difficult, indeed it is as difficult as creation.’ Difficult for some.",

            "In the summer 2013 diary of his visit to London, preparing works for his show at Lisson Gallery, Liu Xiaodong writes of how difficult it is to persuade locals to invite him into their home. After 46 years, Lisson is still an artworld cuckoo in the unhipsterish nest of Edgware Road, but this unlikely ’hood is the London home to Nicholas Logsdail’s multigenerational family of artists. This last year, weapon-mangling Pedro Reyes and claymation heroes Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg have also been welcomed into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile Lisson’s senior artists continue to assert themselves on a global scale – Ai Weiwei and Anish Kapoor have had significant international exhibitions and Marina Abramović has been, well, everywhere. After opening its first international space in Milan two years ago, Lisson recently set up a by-appointment office in New York: rumour has it that a full stateside gallery is soon to follow.",

            "The ‘wolf in cashmere’ recently became the third richest person in the world. As chairman and CEO of luxury group LVMH, a little bit of his Bloomberg-estimated $97.3bn fortune goes to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. This year the private museum gave over its galleries to Gilbert & George, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Courtauld’s hallowed collection of Impressionism. The foundation’s smaller ‘espaces’ in Venice and Tokyo, meanwhile, hosted shows by Philippe Parreno and Christian Boltanski respectively. Yet it was an even more spectacular brand of philanthropy that put Arnault and his family in the spotlight this year, after they publicly announced a €200m donation to Notre-Dame while the cathedral was still smouldering (conveniently overshadowing the €100m earlier pledged by his nemesis François Pinault). Sceptics suggested that Arnault would benefit from a tax break (he says not), and sniping over this and other megadonations was only partially quelled when, in September, they were eventually signed off.",

This last was Robert Colescott, whose paintings, which Blum & Poe hung at their Los Angeles gallery in March, combined surrealism with satire to comment on the state of race politics. Also joining the gallery was young West Coaster Mimi Lauter, who had a show in May, Chicago-based Tony Lewis, Brazilian Solange Pessoa and Japan’s Tomoo Gokita. The gallery has had a presence in Gokita’s hometown of Tokyo since 2014, and it was there, in June, that it showed Agnès Varda. The New Wave filmmaker is undergoing something of a renaissance (and, in collaborations with JR, being embraced by the artworld). That the boys are championing an older artist proves something of a theme: they also gave octogenarian sculptor Wendell Dayton his first major solo show.",

Her holdings, concentrating on art from Latin America, are constantly on loan, as well as increasingly being gifted directly to institutions. For example, the Reina Sofía in Madrid was given 45 works by 33 artists (all made since 1990) in March from the Phelps de Cisneros collection, a bequest that followed another donation of 202 works in January to Reína Sofia, MoMA and five other international museums.

            "This year has been business as usual for the founder of White Cube, who focused on consolidating a growing empire following the opening of two new spaces, in Seoul and New York, last year (joining ones in London, Hong Kong and Paris). Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

            "As any Richter historian will tell you: trying to pinpoint a sense of style to the artist’s work is a task doomed to failure. For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter’s subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‘signature’ aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‘cult of personality’ he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‘It’s a frightening development,’ he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales – Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m – it’s been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman’s New York space in May). But his influence on painting globally remains big.  ",

She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

The Albertina in Vienna staged his largest retrospective to date; while Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, had a smaller exhibition [https://artreview.com/how-to-be-a-real-artist-walter-benjamin-adorno-herzog-ai-weiwei-nathan-fielder/]; and his gothic La Commedia Umana (at more than 8-by-6 metres, one of the largest Murano glass sculptures ever made) hung in Venice’s San Giorgio Maggiore during the Biennale. Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

            "It has been a turbulent 12 months since the head of the four Tate galleries took the number one spot on this list. While discontent and protest ﬁtfully surfaced from the activist-left over BP’s corporate sponsorship, in the spring it was Serota’s detractors on the right who made the most noise. The conservative press gleefully stretched for Oscar Wilde clichés when Tate lost not one but two directors in quick succession. Was it carelessness on Serota’s part? Perhaps not, but Penelope Curtis leaving Tate Britain for Calouste Gulbenkian Museum after a much maligned ﬁve-year tenure, and Chris Dercon announcing his decision to jump ship from Tate Modern to direct Berlin’s Volksbühne (although he’ll be staying in the post until next summer) was not a good look for Serota. \n\nThe ten-storey extension, which dwarfs Tate Modern’s original building like a super cruiseliner on the Venetian skyline, is proving controversial too. Currently four years behind its original opening date – during which performance spaces in the power station’s old oil tanks, opened to much hype in 2012, have sat idle as construction continues above them – the additional space is still missing £30m of funding, although Serota says he is conﬁdent this will be found before the new launch date of June 2016. Last year’s top spot came in recognition of Tate’s vast international network of global acquisitions committees and internationally active curatorial teams. No change there. Nor has all the construction dented its exhibition programme (Tanks aside) and general popularity with punters: a(nother) record – 7.9 million visits across all four sites in 2014–15, with 5.7 million alone stepping into Tate Modern. But with his legacy projects nearing completion, is the sixty-nine-year-old eyeing retirement in some pleasant corner of Southern England?.  ",

            "For the past few years the press has been speculating on seventy-nine-year-old Larry Gagosian’s succession plans for what is regularly estimated as a business with a $1 billion annual turnover (accumulated through the sale of works by the likes of Nan Goldin [https://artreview.com/artist/nan-goldin/], Carol Bove and Richard Prince [https://artreview.com/richard-prince-clearview-ai-and-your-face-gagosian/], who each had a show this year in at least one of Gagosian’s 19 galleries around the world). There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
