            "Contemporary art often likes to name-check philosophy and theory as a source of kudos, but it’s often surprising how few living thinkers have a serious influence in contemporary art debates, reaching both academic and general readerships. French critic Jacques Rancière, however, can claim that kind of influence. From The Politics of Aesthetics (2004), through The Emancipated Spectator (2009), to Dissensus: On Politics and Aesthetics (2010), the seventy-two-year-old professor’s ideas on how art intersects with the political and social worlds have won him an increasingly international and youthful readership who are keen to find a way past the pessimism of earlier postmodern theory.",

Though a historic, established presence in the city (she now represents the late Kippenberger’s estate), she is known for a strong selection of artists that span several generations, media and style: from Seth Price to Karla Black, from Monika Sosnowska to Albert Oehlen. This year she represented two of the Deutsche Börse nominees: Christopher Williams and John Stezaker (the eventual winner), and a Turner Prize nominee, Luke Fowler. Her artists also benefit from Capitain Petzel, gallery space that she shares with Friedrich Petzel in Berlin.",

In the tradition of Paula Cooper and Marian Goodman, she has built a stable of artists at Greene Naftali whose work is conceptually rigorous and visually rich. Among them are Rachel Harrison, Paul Chan, Michael Krebber, the Bernadette Corporation, Gelitin and Guyton/Walker, figures who don’t so much reflect culture as define it. Dedicated and tough-minded, Greene doesn’t shy away from difficult stuff: a 2010 Bjarne Melgaard show featured man-on-horse porn. Nor fun: her after parties go all night, attracting people from Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth to experimental theatre director Richard Maxwell. Perhaps unique in New York, she is as respected by uptown collectors and museum curators as she is by the creative denizens of downtown. She is in it for the long run, and she’ll likely define it, too.",

At the heart of Outset’s activities, though, remains the Outset/Frieze Art Fair Fund to Benefit the Tate Collection, which every year swoops early on Frieze’s white tent – now tents – to cherry-pick from the offerings and enrich Tate’s collection. Ten years down the line, it has added up to £1 million worth of art for Serota’s culture palaces – and accordingly, for the rest of us.",

This year, however, saw the culmination of his 2011 appointment to curate Manifesta 9, in Genk, Belgium. Taking the theme of coal literally – stemming from the colliery venue of this edition of the transient exhibition – this tight show eschewed all expectations of the freewheeling biennial, placing archive material, social artefacts and art (much of which was made from the black stuff ) together, garnering widespread critical and public plaudits for the subtlety of its political aims and acute socioeconomic commentary.",

            "Groys, currently professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at New York University and senior research fellow at the Karlsruhe University for Arts and Design, is a figurehead for how art is currently contextualised. In an interview for this issue of ArtReview, Groys dismisses art criticism as being an exercise in ‘aesthetic taste’ and champions theory-based thinking. A collection of his writing, titled Antiphilosophy, was released this year – following multiple others, including Art Power (from 2008) and Going Public (2010) – and The Guardian noted in its review that what becomes apparent from these essays is the author’s Marxist commitment to presenting philosophy not just as a way of interpreting the world, but as a weapon to change it. Such political, revolutionary grandstanding has made him ever more relevant to a post-Occupy artworld, and numerous invitations to write, deliver lectures and sit on panel discussions have since followed, including appearances at this year’s Documenta and the Kyiv Biennale.",

Once they’ve pulled on their wellies, however, it turns out that Wirth and his wife, Manuela Hauser, are ready to get down with both the mud and the cultural enrichment of his new ’hood. Hauser & Wirth Somerset – a converted seventeenth-century farmhouse and grounds, featuring multiple free-to-enter galleries, outdoor artworks and a buzzy restaurant – opened in July to general artworld approval, but perhaps more importantly, with a neighbourhood-pleasing programme of talks, workshops and site-relevant residencies. How this commitment to grassroots engagement will evolve to fit the decidedly more urban terrain of downtown LA when the 9,300sqm Hauser Wirth & Schimmel opens for business next year remains to be seen.",

For Peyton-Jones, this next year will be her 25th at the helm of the once-humble Hyde Park institution. Her appearance on the society pages alongside Pharrell Williams and other Serpentine partygoers has long been de rigueur, but as a finalist for the 2015 Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Award, Peyton-Jones has been explaining how annual visitor figures reached almost a million across the Serpentine’s two galleries in 2014, and how 85 percent of their £7m turnover is raised from private sources.\n\nCodirector Obrist is, as ever, ubiquitous: outlining the ‘Museum of the Future’ in Doha; touring 15 Rooms to Shanghai; winning the International Folkwang Prize in Essen. ‘In a sense Obrist is a human aggregator,’ wrote Hal Foster, reviewing Obrist’s Ways of Curating in the London Review of Books, ‘almost a social-media-in-person or a hive-mind of one.’ As might be expected, Ways of Curating is but one of 17-odd books authored or coauthored by the hyperactive uber-curator this year – and his river of published interviews and conversation is in turn cited in dozens of other publications. Obrist’s 103,000 Instagram followers chart his ceaseless travel through the location of celebrity contributors to his Post-it notes project – Orhan Pamuk in Istanbul; Olafur Eliasson in Copenhagen; Bret Easton Ellis, John Baldessari and Miranda July in LA – such that it is sometimes easy to forget his ties to an institutional ‘home’.",

            "E-flux, the half-commercial, half-academic outfit headed by this trio of artists continues its hybrid mission, acting as a (paid-for) distribution centre for the artworld ’s press releases, a journal (in which Hito Steyerl has published many of her most influential essays), a partner on many a symposium (particularly the site’s architecture offshoot) and, perhaps not quite so successfully, an online forum for debate. This year, the saga of e-flux’s bid to control the .art top-level domain extension took a new turn. Having lost out in the bidding, e-flux has partnered with the new owner, marketing .art to its extensive network. E-flux’s influence ensured that prominent institutions signed up straightaway (including the Stedelijk Museum and Para Site), with e-flux subscribers getting second dibs before the domain extension was put on wider sale. Meanwhile Vidokle, Aranda and Kuan Wood had their individual art practices to contend with too.",

Since then it’s hosted shows by Urs Fischer and Taryn Simon; new commissions by Rashid Johnson and Yin Xiuzhen, and a group exhibition made in collaboration with disabled professionals, featuring work by Cindy Sherman, Rob Pruitt and others. Garage is Moscow’s go-to destination for contemporary art, but with work already underway on the V-A-C Foundation’s vast Renzo Piano-designed exhibition space (in the former GES2 power plant), scheduled to open in 2019, it won’t have that monopoly for long. Zhukova however isn’t sitting on her laurels. In July, New York digital media company Vice bought a controlling stake in the Center’s Garage magazine, and aims to expand the publication’s global reach and produce its own digital channel. ",

Works from the collection are now an almost constant presence in the Benaki Museum, Athens, for instance, where this year Joannou cocurated a survey of work by the late Greek sculptor George Lappas. In June, while artist Roberto Cuoghi and his team were kiln-firing dozens of ceramic crabs as part of the artist’s Deste commission on Hydra, The Equilibrists opened at the Benaki, featuring a survey of young Greek art selected from open submission and through a hundred studio visits by New Museum curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Massimiliano Gioni. The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer – False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober – all owned by Joannou. ",

The estimated €101 million renovation of the Neue Nationalgalerie started this year, and the museum is projected to be closed for four years. Meanwhile, a new £80m, 14,700sqm modern art institution is planned for a site next door. You may be forgiven for asking whether, with all these capital projects, Kittelmann still has time to think about art. He does: projects in 2015 have included putting together an Andreas Gursky show at the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden-Baden, the Impressionism–Expressionism show at the Alte Nationalgalerie and a Mary Heilmann and David Reed show at the Hamburger Bahnhof: ‘He makes art out of other people’s art because his curatorial moves are really things that we wouldn’t have thought of,’ said Heilmann.",

The Financial Times agreed: ‘Pedrosa’s thoughtful, serious approach showcases the joys and opportunities, as well as the trauma, of displacement and marvellously balances aesthetic pleasure and politics.’ Yet opinion was far from unanimous: the works on show, The Art Newspaper thought, ‘measured by technical rather [than] representative properties, are, frankly, ropey’; Folha de S.Paulo complained that Pedrosa ‘reduced the artists to slogans’. Pedrosa’s interest in identity will be familiar to visitors of Museu de Arte de São Paulo, where he is director (with an extension into neighbouring premises opening in March), where he uses a different theme every year to programme.

Nothing quite like them exists elsewhere, and it’s increasingly evident that Chan is a savant of reformatting in general and democracy minded expansions in particular.\n\nHaving long straddled the roles of artist and activist, and maintained a strong, text-distributing web presence via his National Philistine site, Chan has become a full-blown publisher since founding Badlands Unlimited in 2010. His book of a dead dictator’s 1970s speeches, On Democracy by Saddam Hussein, appeared this year, as did what Chan says is the first group show for iPad, the 50-artist affair How to Download a Boyfriend – ‘beating the market at its own game’, The New Yorker opined, and collapsing the distance between the artworld and the digital realm in a way that could, in the longer term, have major implications.",

He is in charge of the international representation of Mike Nelson, whose labyrinthine installation for the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year had three-hour queues out front in its opening week.\n\nLess difficult to enter, but just as pleasurable to see, was gallery artist Steven Shearer’s Canadian Pavilion, just next door. This has been a transformative year for Henrik Olesen – with a raved-about solo show at the Museum für Gegenwartskunst in a prime slot this summer – and for Pablo Bronstein, with shows at the Kunsthalle Charlottenburg and the ICA in London.

That’d be plenty, but in the past year the Princeton-trained art historian has also published two (admittedly long-gestating) books: a substantial and brilliant study of the ‘apparently marginal activities’ of Marcel Duchamp that additionally serves as a sly exegesis on curating-as-art and an exhortation to artistic boldness, and a tightly researched Afterall ‘One Work’ volume on David Hammons’s iconic 1983 Bliz-aard Ball Sale. Even her predecessor in Basel might be looking on enviously, and he just directed Documenta. Filipovic is ambitious enough to do that too; but also smart enough to rewrite the script.",

This last, Better be watching the clouds (notionally a project from the archives of Raad’s fictional Atlas Group, which collects documentary material related to the contemporary history of Lebanon), was a typical expression of Raad’s sensibility, featuring pages from a book of flora native to the Middle East, onto which he had overlaid the portraits of political leaders connected to the Lebanese Civil War. Outside the gallery space, Raad is a prominent activist within the Gulf Labor Artist Coalition, looking out for those building the baubles of the Emirates. Raad’s students at New York’s Cooper Union are getting a vivid demonstration of how art practice and real life can marry. ",

Albeit a very engaging showoff, adept at using and, in turn, abusing the press. His ideological standpoint, which takes Marx via Lacan, is characterised by a myriad of pop-cultural references drawn into an often spittle-infested, tangent-friendly delivery.\n\nThough by no means just an artworld figure – he had a heavyweight bout with Julian Assange this year, for example – Zizek’s interpretation of prevailing twentieth-century philosophy means there are few theory courses or curator’s reading lists that don’t feature the so-called most dangerous philosopher in the West. Oh, and there’s the rumour he was dating Lady Gaga.",

His programme remains focused on artists from Eastern Europe, among them Attila Csörgö, Vadim Fiškin, Alexander Gutke, the Slovenian collective IRWIN, Dan Perjovschi, Goran Petercol and Tobias Putrih, but also includes young international artists such as Magnus Larsson and Ariel Schlesinger.",

            "Ashkal Alwan, the Beirut-based cultural association founded by Tohmé in 1994, continues to be a driving force in advocating for artists in the region. Aside from generating a thriving local arts scene, Tohmé has become an expert at building networks across the Middle East, North Africa and beyond – an invaluable mission in a country struck by ongoing conflict. In addition to its exhibition programme (including a major show of Simone Fattal’s drawings in 2024) and free educational programmes for artists (workshops this year were led by the likes of Haig Aivazian, Marwa Arsanios and Joe Namy), the organisation ran a series of artist-film screenings at Beirut’s Sursock Museum. It was also one of the venues for ‘Why Germany’, an international lecture series reflecting on the recent crackdown on free speech in that country, for which it invited writer and academic Yasmeen Daher to consider the evolution of the Palestine solidarity movement. Tohmé’s skills as a cultural organiser are likely to have played a part in her recent appointment as director of the next Istanbul Biennial [https://artreview.com/christine-tohme-to-curate-18th-istanbul-biennial/].",

No vanity project, the start-up has Angelika Taschen herself coming onboard next year – leaving the company that bears her ex-husband’s family name – and has already issued a catalogue of assiduously designed and manufactured survey and monograph hardcovers. Meanwhile, Lohmann has joined Art Basel as its VIP coordinator in Germany, and the brutal environs of the Berlin gallery, which showcases just some of the couple’s sculpture collection, continues to attract a steady stream of prebooked visitors.",

            "Just as you were the settling in to read last November’s Power 100 issue, Gorvy, the chairman and international head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s auction house, saw his New York saleroom hammer down Francis Bacon’s triptych Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) for $142.4m (£88.3m), the most expensive contemporary artwork ever sold at auction. That figure, along with the current vogue among collectors for paying high prices at auction for new works by very young artists, goes perhaps a little way towards accounting for the fact that sales of contemporary art now account for close to half of all auction business. For Gorvy, it’s booming, and with new collectors flooding in there’s no sign of a bust in sight. In a market like this one, and when your auction house is top of the food chain – Christie’s had record sales of just under £800m in the first six months of 2014, a rise of 20 percent over the same period in 2013 – you’re going to have to move jobs before you’ll be off this list.",

Continua’s Beijing space opened in 2005. This year, while most dealers were chasing collectors to ex-urban resorts of the rich, Continua took a punt on central Paris (as well as a popup for Anish Kapoor in Dubai). ‘There was sadness’ to the shuttered city, Fiaschi told The Art Newspaper. They opened, he added ‘to generate smiles’, first with a JR-curated exhibition pre-refurb, followed by two group shows. Still undergoing renovation is the controversially privatised Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo, where the gallery staged a small show of Cuban artists in anticipation of opening a space within the complex. Also conflicted is the trio’s operation in Cuba, which some Cuban activists have accused of legitimising the government.",

The power of the Berlin-based dealership is to consistently straddle various worlds – high-end museum shows, highly covetable and sellable work, clever artists with critical punch and sleek, almost chic wares.\n\nThe gallery’s artists, including Tatiana Trouvé, Jeppe Hein and Kris Martin, have had a generous serving of major institutional shows this year, and the gallery continues to stake out a secure place for itself, influencing commercial and critical agendas internationally.",

            "That Szymczyk’s staging of Documenta 14 across Athens and Kassel divided opinion might have been expected, given the curator’s promise to challenge preconceptions about what the major exhibition could be. Yet controversy shifted into crisis when it emerged late last year that the organisation had overspent by €7m, leading the Kassel branch of Germany’s far-right AfD party to sue Szymczyk and CEO Annette Kulenkampff for mismanaging public funds (they were cleared in August of any wrongdoing). That the exhibition had been politicised was confirmed in October by the removal of Olu Oguibe’s Monument to Strangers and Refugees (2017) from Kassel’s central square by the local government. Szymczyk might have been guilty of overreach, but his radical decentring of the quinquennial – twinned exhibitions complemented by expansive publishing and public programmes exploring indigeneity, antifascism, resistance, identity and marginality – provoked conversations that feel increasingly pressing. Not to mention that his recent travails reveal the upped stakes in the European culture wars. His next move is attended with interest.",

She has established herself as a major collector, increasingly internationally, with an eye (helped by a curatorial team) for what fits with her and husband Poju’s London-based private institution (together with a space on Broadway in New York and a residency programme on an island in Poju’s native Finland). In September Anita told The New York Times, ‘We prefer artists who like to work on longterm projects with institutions. The get-richquick painters are another story.’ So no ‘crapstraction’, then. This policy is borne out in their shows over the past year, including Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch (on now), Michael E. Smith, Adriano Costa, Heather Phillipson and, from an older generation, Albert Oehlen. Over in Finland hotshots Caragh Thuring, Sam Falls and Nicolas Deshayes holed up on the island to make work, as various vIps stopped by to take a peek.   ",

(Given this supportive emphasis, it’s unsurprising that Philbin describes the Hammer’s primary audience as artists.) Though region-based selections may have their problems, in a period in which there are fears about the homogenisation of the LA museums (due to the growing powers of Eli Broad and MOCA), the Hammer and LAXART will help to guarantee a strong home–city scene.",

            "This year Sharp and Slotover have taken a step back from running the fairs they founded in London (that’ll be Frieze London and Frieze Masters, the latter the duo’s venture into not-so-contemporary art) and New York. Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes. \n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there’s Slotover’s influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city’s East End.",

            "Speaking to The Korea Times during the opening of Correspondence: Lee Ufan and Mark Rothko at Pace’s Seoul branch, CEO Glimcher was in a philosophical mood. ‘Artists are creating something that’s purely of the spirit, but we’re hoping someone will actually spend money on it. And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

As the former member of the Italian Communist Party told Vogue this year, family takes up another third, while the rest of her time is devoted to ‘culture and the Fondazione’. The Venice-and-Milan-based private institution is no trinket (with Tokyo and Shanghai project spaces), and Prada is very hands-on, telling Vogue how she struggled to find a curator who would fully embrace her vision of a future show on feminism. She did, however, get the likes of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler to curate Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Technology and Power, 1500–2025, a Marx-tinged show on tech and power that closed in January; while Meriem Bennani installed a solo exhibition in Milan, Christoph Büchel [https://artreview.com/christoph-buchel-monte-di-pieta-fondazione-prada-venice-biennale/] in Venice, Michaël Borremans in China and Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin in Japan.",

            "In the sense that there’ve been no newspaper hogging auctions or switches of direction, Damien Hirst has had a relatively unassuming year. Which means numerous exhibitions: at L&M Arts in New York, Gagosian in New York, Galería Hilario Galguera in New Mexico and Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum. This last retrospective not only found Hirst partying with Albert II, the principality’s crown prince; it also included spot, spin and butterfly paintings, all series which, he announced at the Gagosian show (entitled End of an Era), he would no longer be producing.\n\nThis may to some extent slow the shrinking of Hirst’s market – down by 93 percent last year and bound to be lower this annum – and allay the artist’s detractors, who in August reiterated and expanded on accusations of plagiarism. A charge Hirst branded ‘gibberish’. Still, Hirst isn’t one for cooling his heels. His Murderme art collection grows apace, his Other Criteria publishing wing and retail outlets continue to turn out books, sell multiples and support exhibitions – and he’s rumoured to have a longterm gig booked in: a Tate retrospective to coincide with London’s 2012 Olympics. ",

However, Miro has come back with a major addition of her own this year, in the form of an elegant new gallery space in London’s Mayfair. And other gallery artists continue to maintain a high profile. \n\nElmgreen & Dragset’s exhibitions in 2013 have included a yearlong public project in Munich’s main squares and a major site-specific installation in the old textile galleries at the V&A in London. Meanwhile the ever-popular and populist Grayson Perry becomes the first visual artist to deliver the BBC’s annual Reith Lectures. The recent addition of Kara Walker to the gallery’s roster won’t do any harm either. ",

These will include Xu Bing’s Tobacco Project (1999–), a newly purchased ($3 million) painting by Liu Ye and a commissioned work from abstract painter Ding Yi.\n\nIn Jakarta he is creating what he calls a ‘museum-type office’ by relocating his company and the Yuz Museum to a new space; of this, an area of more than 1,000sqm will be reserved for a permanent exhibition. Via his not-for-profit Yuz Foundation, Tek continues in his role as a patron, funding Asia Art Archive, the Indonesian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale and Zeng Fanzhi’s retrospective in Paris.",

Curated by the gallerist and Francesco Bonami, the exhibition, like the architecture housing it, sought to ‘fuse elements of historicism with modernity’. Yan was the subject of a solo show at De Carlo’s second Milanese gallery in September, while fellow painter Jamian Juliano-Villani (pictures of Amy Winehouse, goats wearing Ugg boots, a dog waving a knife), took over the London space over the summer. She was followed by the more minimal, abstract canvases of McArthur Binion (who also exhibited, earlier this year, in De Carlo’s Hong Kong gallery), described by the Financial Times as ‘some of the finest and most thoughtprovoking contemporary paintings to be seen in Europe right now’.",

            "As countries in Asia look to establish and substantiate their own art histories independently from Western narratives, the Asia Art Archive in Hong Kong performs a lowkey but indispensable role in collecting and sharing information. This vital resource for scholars and art historians, cofounded 19 years ago by Claire Hsu, now has over 80,000 records in its collections, stretching from exhibition catalogues and materials to artist’s personal archives. But it’s not all about art history for the nonprofit organisation, which also responds to the times and looks to set the agenda through talks, residencies and research that complement its ever-expanding library. In March, for example, it held an exhibition of the late Singaporean performance artist Lee Wen’s sketchbooks and plans to celebrate its 20th anniversary next year with a busy programme. One highlight of which is a collaboration with Jakarta-based educational project Gudskul for Art Basel Hong Kong.",

Where we’re going, we don’t need roads.’ But roads certainly help if, like billionaire mining magnate Paz, you want to bring people to see your 5,000-acre botanic garden and sculpture park (neither of which terms really do justice to Inhotim, his vast playground of exhibition pavilions and large-scale installations, overseen by curator Rodrigo Moura and advised by Allan Schwartzman). Because now that the truly dedicated art pilgrims (not to mention the people from underprivileged local communities who also visit) have already flown to Belo Horizonte in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, and taken the 90-minute, mostly dirt-track drive, Paz is after the rest of us. Roads will help, as will the hotels, theatre and convention centre that Paz says he is also planning. Whether all this development will spoil Inhotim’s mystique remains to be seen.   ",

It is not just the high profile at home that marks out the gallery, but the global network that its geographically-diverse artist roster has firmly infiltrated. Wilfredo Prieto represented Cuba at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], while WangShui, Bárbara Sánchez-Kane [https://artreview.com/barbara-sanchez-kane-new-lexicons-for-embodiment-kurimanzutto-new-york-review/] and Ana Segovia were in the main show; Haegue Yang [https://artreview.com/artist/haegue-yang/] showed in London and Chicago; Minerva Cuevas exhibited at CC Foundation, Shanghai; and the gallery worked with peers Shibunkaku for a presentation at Art Collaborations Kyoto. Kurimanzutto’s satellite space in New York gives them clout there, too: this year, the Met installed specially commissioned architectural interventions by Nairy Baghramian and Petrit Halilaj, and in February the gallery announced the representation of the estate of the late New York icon John Giorno.",

This year marks 20 years since they moved to their Mitte headquarters, and 25 since they began working with Jorge Pardo, an anniversary celebrated by a recent show. Elsewhere in the programme were thoughtful group shows on negation and the construction of selfhood, a loopily cerebral Mario García Torres exhibition involving an animatronic tortoise and performances by Austrian screen legend Helmut Berger, a stormily politicised James Benning presentation and, demonstrating that Neuger and Riemschneider won’t be pinned down, a display of paintings by Billy Childish.  ",

He celebrated – how else? – with a show of Beuys’s works on paper at his London gallery at the start of the year, and another at Ropac’s Seoul branch at the end of the year. Having opened in Salzburg in 1983, and adding two London and two Paris spaces along the way, Ropac landed in South Korea in 2021 and this year doubled the square meterage there by adding another floor, allowing for a simultaneous exhibition of Donald Judd’s sculptures and paintings in September. As well as some of the great American estates, Ropac has become the de facto rep for canonical artists of the German-speaking world, among them VALIE EXPORT, Anselm Kiefer, Not Vital and Imi Knoebel. Georg Baselitz turned eighty-five this year, so there were more celebrations to arrange, with shows staged by the painter at nine institutions around the world, including at London’s Serpentine galleries and Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich.",

Picking up the bill to the glam event – a fundraiser for the long-running New York performance biennial – was Chang, the founder of the Beijing-based Domus Collection (and collector of Johnson’s work). Live art is an expensive business, with little in the way of a market to help it along, and Chang, as president of Performa’s board, has been a major backer. Yet it’s not just cutting-edge work that attracts Chang: he’s a (heavily involved) trustee at the Royal Academy in London, as well as vice chair of the International Council at Tate. Of course this is just the public face of Chang’s patronage. As an avid collector, he is searching out, he once told ArtReview, works that have ‘truth and beauty’; when Chang favours an artist, he becomes a supporter in more ways than one.",

Extract Kortun from this picture, however, and it’d likely look very different. Curator, writer, teacher, director of nonprofit gallery and research centre SALT, and go-to sounding board and mediator for the Turkish art scene (see his insider commentary during the Gezi Park protests and supportive intervention in last year’s troubled biennial), he’s been – and remains – inestimably important in the infrastructural growth of a city which, as next year’s Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev-directed Istanbul Biennial gathers pace, will only receive more attention.  ",

Most people call him a pioneer, in the light of his work – both in terms of research and exhibition organisation – in reviving Chinese art, while Chang himself is likely to think of himself as more curator than dealer. ‘In a way,’ he told Art Radar journal earlier this year, ‘the gallery has become one of the multiple platforms I operate.’ Other platforms include the Asia Art Archive (which he cofounded), the China Academy of Art (where he is a guest professor) and the China Club in Hong Kong (which hosts the collection he put together with David Tang). And who was on hand at this year’s Art Basel Hong Kong to introduce Anselm Franke, the then-recently announced curator of the upcoming Shanghai Biennale? Chang, of course.",

For his Autumn/ Winter collection for Saint Laurent, Hedi Slimane issued an invitation and showbook featuring artwork supplied by Baldessari and centred the collection around three heavily-sequined dresses inspired by the artist’s 50-year career. Sticking to things French: the artist also unveiled a 30m-long light installation in Paris titled Your Name in Lights (2011), in which members of the public’s names are… well, you get the picture. Yet it was back home that Baldessari showed what an artworld powerhouse he is – beyond, even, the fact of his canonical art – when he, alongside peers Barbara Kruger and Catherine Opie, gave MoCA’s new director, Philippe Vergne, a vote of confidence by returning to the beleaguered museum’s board in March this year, after having left it in June 2012 in protest at the direction Jeffrey Deitch was taking the institution.  ",

However, as the head of Kaikai Kiki (the artist’s art production company), Murakami has successfully introduced his artists into the artworld. Murakami’s personal career is still flourishing: two solo gallery shows (in Hong Kong and LA) and one institutional show, Takashi in Superflat Wonderland, at Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul. His debut feature film, Jellyfish Eyes (2013), had its international premiere in April. And the Japanese makeup brand Shu Uemura has announced a cosmetics collection, titled Six Hearts Princes, based on Murakami’s 6HP anime project.",

Which is good, because what with Brazil’s political situation and the fact that a third edition of her boutique art fair did not materialise this year, she has had a lot to take in her stride. More positively, she had her work cut out with the many museum shows for the artists represented by her São Paulo-based gallery. In September the largest show of Cildo Meireles’s work ever staged in Latin America took over the galleries of Sesc Pompeia, showing the artist at both his most spectacular and subtly political. The six-decade survey of Anna Maria Maiolino’s work at the Whitechapel Gallery in London (complemented by a show back home in Strina’s Jardins space) was similarly comprehensive. Leonor Antunes, another of her artists to have a stellar year, represented Portugal at the Venice Biennale and won the Zurich Art Prize 2019.",

In September the achingly hip Anne Imhof had a show in Berlin; in February Heji Shin showed her portraits of Kanye West (fresh from their outing earlier this year at Kunsthalle Zürich). The cool middle-aged people were represented there, too: an exhibition of Michael Krebber’s austere works in May ‘still managed to piss people off’, reported Artforum. But it was a dead cool person who really stole the limelight in 2019. In the early 1950s, Andy Warhol collaborated with author Ralph Thomas (‘Corkie’) Ward on a series of self-published books. The first of these, A Is an Alphabet, a collection of 26 loose pages that feature Warhol’s cute illustrations and Ward’s weird rhymes – ‘a surreal, horny fairytale’, as Interview succinctly described it – went on show in Berlin before travelling to New York.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

(Koons donated the concept, not the finished work; one critic called it a ‘poisoned chalice’.) Despite this, Koons remains undeterred, focusing on a series of bags being created with Louis Vuitton: a Mona Lisa backpack or a Rubens duffel, anyone? When it comes to an unruffled engagement with capitalism and the smoothest of productions, Koons remains king. ",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

In between he supplied a gallerist-tormenting reboot of This Is Competition (2004) as part of 14 Rooms in Basel, a response to the work of Frank Gehry at Luma Foundation’s Solaris Chronicles at Arles and a marathon chat at the Swiss Pavilion of the Venice Architectural Biennale (all three Hans Ulrich Obrist-related projects – make of that what you will). While there has been some critical wearying of his interventional shtick, and questions as to how well his works endure, there’s no doubting either his popular pulling power, or the influence he’s having on the status and practice of performance.   ",

Though his business includes the German art magazine Monopol and JRP Ringier, the art book publisher whose recent output ranges from the Art Basel catalogue to artist Scott King’s graphic novel, it’s not for these that our man is included here. Ringier is an avid collector and all-round art fan. More than 200 works populate the publisher’s Zürich headquarters, and artists have been commissioned to design the company’s annual report since 1997 (last year it was Laura Owens). More of Ringier’s personal collection is made available to Pool, a programme that gives an emerging curator time with both Ringier’s and Maja Hoffmann’s art. This year Arthur Fink was the appointed fellow, staging a show at Luma / Westbau, Zürich.",

By contrast, London sales throughout the year proved strong, if not earth-shattering, but for Westphal – chairman of contemporary art Europe – the auction game may be changing anyway: in October, Sotheby’s expanded its S/2 private sales gallery format from New York to London, effectively muscling in on the business of gallerists and private dealers.\n\nPrivate sales are a growth area for Sotheby’s, so S/2 London plans five selling shows a year. Sotheby’s shareholders seem to like it: the company’s shares have risen continuously, even while billionaire activist investor Dan Loeb has recently been gunning for Sotheby’s CEO William Ruprecht to step down.",

Back at the two Glasgow spaces Webster calls home, an exhibition exchange with Standard in Oslo was announced. The Modern Institute will reciprocate in due course, before planning subsequent exchanges with other international galleries. \n\nWith its stable of artists largely consisting of the gallerist’s generational peers – Simon Starling (whose epic CGI video commission has been on show at Tate Britain all year), Urs Fischer (everywhere), Jim Lambie and Cathy Wilkes among them – Webster’s gallery is small enough to be able to instigate such deft manoeuvres, but big enough and respected enough to have the endeavour noticed and cheered on.",

            "Artist, curator, institutional director – Al Qasimi can claim to belong to nearly every constituent sector of the artworld (albeit these days she’s not really that well known for her painting). Plus, in the real world, she’s royalty. And yet, in recent years she has leveraged her expertise and knowledge of art from the Gulf region and further afield, to operate in geographies beyond the Emirate and areas in which she can absolutely rely on royal privilege. An exhibition of paintings she curated by the senior Māori artist Emily Karaka, which opened this autumn at the Sharjah Art Foundation, of which she is also president and founding director, may be indicative of the direction planned for the 2026 Biennale of Sydney [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-lead-the-2026-biennale-of-sydney/]. Al Qasimi was this year appointed curator of the Australian survey, which she will work on while developing her plans for the 2025 Aichi Triennale [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-direct-aichi-triennale-2025/] in Japan, of which she is artistic director (the first non-Japanese person to occupy the position, although she speaks the language, having studied there). Having previously curated the Lahore Biennale (in 2020) and the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Al Qasimi is in demand, and her global presence is reflected in her home institution’s programming, which, in addition to Karaka, has featured survey exhibitions of South African multimedia icon William Kentridge, Brazilian painter Antonio Dias and Pakistani artist and Women’s Action Forum cofounder Lala Rukh, not to mention the annual March Meeting [https://artreview.com/the-top-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-march-2024/#:~:text=March%20Meeting%202024%3A%20Tawashujat] conference. Next February marks the opening of the 16th Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/] (Al Qasimi curated the 2023 edition [https://artreview.com/artists-for-2023-sharjah-biennial-revealed/], developing a programme initiated by the late Okwui Enwezor, having been involved with the event – as director – since 2003, when she cocurated the sixth edition). For this edition, Al Qasimi has appointed an all-female team of curators [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] that includes many of the leading lights among curators operating in the context of the global majority, including Sri Lanka’s Natasha Ginwala [https://artreview.com/artist/natasha-ginwala/], Indonesian curator Alia Swastika [https://artreview.com/artist/alia-swastika/?year=2024], Bahraini-Singaporean artist Amal Khalaf, New Zealand artist Megan Tamati-Quennell and Turkish curator Zeynep Öz. Moreover, in the context of an artworld in which cancellations and boycotts are rife – coming from every direction – and generating a consequent culture of fear, Al Qasimi remains one of the few voices still prepared to use the platform art (and royal privilege) affords them in order to express their opinions directly and to keep discussions that most people allow to fade away firmly in the spotlight, whether they concern the current carnage in Palestine and Lebanon or those suffering from other conflicts across the globe. Beyond all that, Al Qasimi also serves as president of the International Biennale Association, president of the hugely influential Africa Institute in Sharjah and on the board of Ashkal Alwan in Beirut. She is also on the advisory boards of the Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi and Darat al Funun in Amman. Beyond her involvement with art, she also founded the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, and earlier this year presented a clothing collection in London which was developed from the work of her late brother, who worked in the fashion industry. But beyond her personal achievements, Al Qasimi is also a symbol of the increasing influence of the Gulf region in the spheres of finance, commerce, politics, sports and entertainment, and, of course (but perhaps primarily by virtue of the first two elements on this list) art.",

Kara Walker’s A Subtlety (2014) at the Domino Sugar Factory in Brooklyn, a giant sugar Negress posed like a Sphinx, was both critically lauded and incessantly, sometimes offensively Instagrammed. A tricky moment arrived when over 100 artists and intellectuals, including Lucy Lippard and Walid Raad, signed a petition calling for artists to withdraw from ‘Living as Form’, a Creative Time exhibition put together by the organisation’s influential chief curator, Nato Thompson, which toured to the Technion in Israel, a university and research centre connected to military technologies then being used to bomb Palestine. Black Radical Brooklyn, four projects set around Weeksville, a community centre in Brooklyn, met with a warm reception, however, highlighting an important history while creating artist-led community projects.  ",

            "There are many reasons why Matthew Marks is a perennial figure on this list, but all of them come back to the artists the New York and LA gallerist works with. King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‘Artists… like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.’ His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who’s who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks’s skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive. ",

Organised chronologically and installed, as always, by the artist and his team (over 16 days and nights, he says), it provided an easy image of the photographer’s journey from nightclub imagery to a more wide-ranging experimentation in representing the world around him (and beyond: astronomy is a passion). Meanwhile, Fragile, a show touring African cities over the past five years, arrived at its final stop across two venues in Lagos; his solo at Mumok, Vienna, closed after an extended run in August. And then Tillmans was back in London for a round of fundraising on behalf of the ICA, where he has been chair since 2019. Demonstrating that his penchant for hedonism isn’t over, Tillmans outlined plans to make the art institution party central, including a licence to serve alcohol until 6am.",

Nine years later there is more than enough evidence to suggest she stands by this vow. ‘Aggie’ Gund doesn’t just dash into MoMA once in a while to fulfil her role as its president emerita or as chairman of MoMA PS1; she gets involved. In September she even appeared on PS1 director Klaus Biensenbach’s Instagram feed doing stretches in preparation for a rehearsal of a Xavier Le Roy performance (the artist currently has a show at PS1). Besides MoMA, Gund chairs the Mayor of New York’s Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, is founder of the Studio in a School Association, is on the board of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and is honorary trustee of Independent Curators International and, in her hometown of Cleveland, of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art. She collects, she donates, she’s irrepressible. ",

If his work affects the corporate aesthetic – his exhibition at Maureen Paley, London, in September consisted of slick architectural interventions and more films – then visitors to Kunsthalle Wien in July would have been reassured that Gillick puts his heart and soul into his work, as they witnessed the production of a feature film he is making with Austrian collective Gelitin. He is equally influential behind closed doors, sitting on the steering committee of Maja Hoffmann’s Luma Foundation. With such consistent success, Gillick’s blue Mondays should be few and far between.",

            "By her recent standards the past year has been a relatively quiet one for Trockel on the exhibition front. There was a solo show at New York’s Gladstone Gallery at the end of last year, another at the Paris gallery space of rebooted journal Cahiers d’Art and a survey of ceramic works from the past decade of her thirty-year career at the rebooted Aspen Art Museum. And, of course, her work featured in a number of group shows, among them the Gwangju Biennale. Featuring a wide range of media – sculpture, video, drawing, textiles to name but a few – Trockel’s oeuvre is notoriously hard to pin down, but that didn’t stop her picking up the CHF 150,000 Roswitha Haftmann Prize, the biggest in Europe, in recognition of both the importance of her extraordinary artistic output and the influence she exerts on younger artists, in part through 16 years of teaching in her role as Professor of Sculpture at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.   ",

            "Gates is an artist who knows as much about the intricacies of planning law as he does about the inside of a studio. His sculpture was the focal point of a survey that opened in May at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, materially derived from dilapidated architecture and the urban realm, and specifically informed by Freedmen’s Town in Houston’s Fourth Ward. With regards to the latter, Gates is advising an initiative that plans to preserve this historic neighbourhood built and shaped by Black people following emancipation: an endeavour that’s in the mould of the socially engaged mini-empire he has been building on the South Side of Chicago since 2006. Over in Tokyo, the artist’s Afro-Mingei exhibition at the Mori Art Museum, which imagined ‘the artistic possibilities of combining Black aesthetics and Japanese craft philosophies to envision hybrid-culture futures’, laid the groundwork for incense and sake collaborations with small family-owned businesses in Japan. This mix of commerce and creativity made him an obvious choice for Prada’s diversity council, where Gates has spearheaded a mentorship programme for designers of colour.",

The issuing of the seventh edition this year was notably delayed, not once but twice, due to Russia’s invasion. In October, however, the winner was finally announced: Bangladeshi artist Ashfika Rahman, chosen from a shortlist of 21 by a big-name jury that included Cecilia Alemani [https://artreview.com/artist/cecilia-alemani/] and Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung [https://artreview.com/artist/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung/]. Pinchuk, who Donald Trump once called ‘a very, very special man’ (and who hired Kellyanne Conway, an official in the 45th president’s administration, as his lobbyist this year), bankrolled a vast exhibition during the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] titled From Ukraine: Dare to Dream, in which artists ranging from Shilpa Gupta to Nikita Kadan to Otobong Nkanga [https://artreview.com/artist/otobong-nkanga-2/] reflected on what the curators described as ‘an ongoing power struggle’, while ‘storms and climate change ravage lands far and wide’ and ‘political extremes are seizing their growing momentum’.

This year, McQueen received a solo exhibition that continues to occupy both Dia sites in New York, with several film works and a new photographic series on display in the institution’s Chelsea space, and in a massive former factory site Beacon is his new installation Bass, the basement space filled only with coloured lighting and reverberating with snatches of music (The music an extended jam session, recorded in-situ, between different forms of the titular instrument, played by a stellar ensemble that included Meshell Ndegeochello and jazz veteran Marcus Miller.) The show received widespread acclaim, and will travel to Switzerland’s Schaulager next year. He also released the documentary Occupied City [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-review/], in which he slowly traced and filmed all the locations that appear in author, historian and producer (and McQueen’s wife) Bianca Stigter’s book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940–1945 (2019). Offering a meditative study of the Dutch capital under the Nazis, it was a cinematic tour de force that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.\n\nSo far, so auteur. McQueen’s second celluloid outing this year, Blitz, however, which opened to mixed reviews, demonstrated how mainstream he can go. Telling the story of a young boy during the World War II bombing of London, it was ‘an old-fashioned children’s adventure movie, a rollicking yarn that might have been on television on a Bank Holiday afternoon’, thought the BBC. ‘Shockingly conventional’, Variety noted. But McQueen seems confident straddling both documentary and fiction forms, as well as arthouse and (attempted) blockbuster modes, and continues to serve as a model to artists who might want to make work that can occupy the gallery, the cinema, as well as home streaming platforms.",

            "When Isa Genzken tells us to Make Yourself Pretty!, ArtReview reaches obediently for the powder compact, no questions asked. This emphatically titled exhibition – near double the size of the artist’s 2013 MoMA retrospective – came courtesy of Beatrix Ruf last December, a year after taking the helm of Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum. Long a champion of Genzken’s, this was the show in which the curator nailed her colours to the mast of that venerable institution. This April the show travelled to Berlin amid much homecoming fanfare. New York’s not forgotten Genzken quite yet, though: over the summer the artist’s nine-metre-high Two Orchids blossomed in Central Park. As for her influence on the coming generation? A quick spin around this year’s Turner Prize nominees turns up enigmatic assemblages, animistic concrete forms, urban detritus, weird clothing, New York pop culture – Genzken everywhere, in other words, peeping around the edges.  ",

That loss is not always a bad thing was perhaps the message of Brian Belott, the self-proclaimed ‘Master of Discard’, who closed the gallery with his thrift-store assemblages. Nor is Brown likely to mope: he had four artists in the international exhibition at the Venice Biennale – Ed Atkins, Frida Orupabo, Avery Singer and Golden Lion winner Arthur Jafa – with Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys representing Belgium. There were also shows for Alex Katz and Ella Kruglyanskaya in his Harlem space and Charlemagne Palestine and Laura Owens at his Rome outpost, while Karl Holmqvist joined the restaurant/gallery that Brown and Rirkrit Tiravanija run in upstate New York. This autumn there was a trip to Paris to stage a show at Galerie Patrick Seguin.",

Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

After 46 years, Lisson is still an artworld cuckoo in the unhipsterish nest of Edgware Road, but this unlikely ’hood is the London home to Nicholas Logsdail’s multigenerational family of artists. This last year, weapon-mangling Pedro Reyes and claymation heroes Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg have also been welcomed into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile Lisson’s senior artists continue to assert themselves on a global scale – Ai Weiwei and Anish Kapoor have had significant international exhibitions and Marina Abramović has been, well, everywhere. After opening its first international space in Milan two years ago, Lisson recently set up a by-appointment office in New York: rumour has it that a full stateside gallery is soon to follow.",

            "The ‘wolf in cashmere’ recently became the third richest person in the world. As chairman and CEO of luxury group LVMH, a little bit of his Bloomberg-estimated $97.3bn fortune goes to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. This year the private museum gave over its galleries to Gilbert & George, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Courtauld’s hallowed collection of Impressionism. The foundation’s smaller ‘espaces’ in Venice and Tokyo, meanwhile, hosted shows by Philippe Parreno and Christian Boltanski respectively. Yet it was an even more spectacular brand of philanthropy that put Arnault and his family in the spotlight this year, after they publicly announced a €200m donation to Notre-Dame while the cathedral was still smouldering (conveniently overshadowing the €100m earlier pledged by his nemesis François Pinault). Sceptics suggested that Arnault would benefit from a tax break (he says not), and sniping over this and other megadonations was only partially quelled when, in September, they were eventually signed off.",

This last was Robert Colescott, whose paintings, which Blum & Poe hung at their Los Angeles gallery in March, combined surrealism with satire to comment on the state of race politics. Also joining the gallery was young West Coaster Mimi Lauter, who had a show in May, Chicago-based Tony Lewis, Brazilian Solange Pessoa and Japan’s Tomoo Gokita. The gallery has had a presence in Gokita’s hometown of Tokyo since 2014, and it was there, in June, that it showed Agnès Varda. The New Wave filmmaker is undergoing something of a renaissance (and, in collaborations with JR, being embraced by the artworld). That the boys are championing an older artist proves something of a theme: they also gave octogenarian sculptor Wendell Dayton his first major solo show.",

Another astute commentator on the artworld, artist David Salle, and the lucrative estate of Robert Rauschenberg also joined the gallery’s roster this year. With locations in New York, Brussels and Seoul [https://artreview.com/gladstone-gallery-to-open-new-seoul-space/], and artists ranging from Matthew Barney [https://artreview.com/matthew-barney-secondary-no-pain-no-gain/] to Marisa Merz and Rachel Rose (all of whom had shows), as well as the likes of Rirkrit Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] and Sarah Lucas (who have had significant shows elsewhere this year), Gladstone has colossal spread.

Their private museum, The Broad, in downtown Los Angeles, is one of the most important such institutions in the US, and while the couple have not historically been so adventurous in the nature of their acquisitions, they make up for this conservatism in sheer dollar spend. Their holdings include works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jasper Johns, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama and Andy Warhol, and they estimate they’ve made 8,500 loans to over 500 institutions around the world in their lifetimes. This year The Broad was bolder, making a statement by staging a new retrospective of Shirin Neshat. While highly decorated, the Iranian artist has never had a show on such a scale – opening in October, this vast survey includes approximately 230 photographs and eight videoworks – so the Broads can be credited with offering a corrective.",

This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

Then again, the collector (and MoMA board member) whose donations to the museum between 1997 and 2016 form this sweeping survey of Latin American art, Sur moderno: Journeys of Abstraction – The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift, is hardly your ordinary buyer. Her holdings, concentrating on art from Latin America, are constantly on loan, as well as increasingly being gifted directly to institutions. For example, the Reina Sofía in Madrid was given 45 works by 33 artists (all made since 1990) in March from the Phelps de Cisneros collection, a bequest that followed another donation of 202 works in January to Reína Sofia, MoMA and five other international museums. Hers is a name worth remembering for independent curators and scholars, too: Phelps de Cisneros is the purse behind various residencies and research fellowships, including the Independent Curators International’s annual travel grant.",

He will be its third director in eight years when he takes up the position in 2019. Biesenbach is not the stereotypical ‘safe pair of hands’, but while some of his exhibitions in New York have failed to garner critical acclaim, this is countered by lauded shows such as this year’s Cathy Wilkes solo at PS1, and his habit of championing artists the rest of us are yet to cotton on to. And there is no doubt he has the skills to steady the ship. Biesenbach knows that where he goes, attention is paid. The only blip this year came with a lawsuit issued by curator Nikki Columbus alleging that MoMA PS1 had offered her a curatorial position, only to rescind the offer when it found out that she was pregnant.",

Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

She ‘drafts’ shows like a draughtswoman, she says; ‘you curate pork to make prosciutto’. Either way, there was no filler this year at Turin’s Castello di Rivoli, of which she is director, and Cerruti Villa, which put its $600m collection of modern art on display for the first time. The former hosted exhibitions by artist Michael Rakowitz and Anri Sala. Yet the bulk of Christov-Bakargiev’s energy has this year been devoted to preparing the Cerruti collection – amassed by entrepreneur Francesco Federico Cerruti from the late 1960s to 2014 – for its big public reveal in April. Through a body of work ranging from Francisco de Goya’s The Disasters of War (1863) to Medardo Rosso’s The Jewish Child (1892), as well as more recent paintings by Francis Bacon, Alberto Burri and Pablo Picasso, the collection didn’t need much hyping.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

At the end of 2018, the forthcoming Whitney Biennial – at the museum he’s directed since 2003 – became a flashpoint for controversy when employees demanded the removal of board member Warren B. Kanders over his involvement with teargas manufacturer Safariland. This after the 2017 biennial had been embroiled in a war of words over its inclusion of a painting accused of sensationalising racist violence. This time around, Weinberg dithered, artists quit the biennial and Kanders eventually resigned. One sensed damage-control when, in September, the institution broke ground on David Hammons’s monumental public project Day’s End and Weinberg described the installation as representing ‘our commitment to community and civic good’. Meanwhile, the Whitney continued to settle into its downtown home, with a big Warhol retrospective and an emphasis on shows for artists of colour (Pope.L, Kevin Beasley, Derek Fordjour). How much reputational damage the biennial hullabaloo has caused in the long term remains to be seen.",

            "As any Richter historian will tell you: trying to pinpoint a sense of style to the artist’s work is a task doomed to failure. For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter’s subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‘signature’ aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‘cult of personality’ he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‘It’s a frightening development,’ he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales – Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m – it’s been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman’s New York space in May). But his influence on painting globally remains big.  ",

            "Since 1977, when, after an early foray into multiples, she opened her New York gallery with a show by Marcel Broodthaers, Goodman has dedicated her considerable energies to promoting exchange between the American and European artworlds. She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

            "‘While I agree that there have been great strides in making things better, we still have a ways to go before there’s real parity,’ wrote Sherman as part of an online debate on sexism in the artworld earlier this year. ‘I am well aware that my prices aren’t anywhere near those of my male counterparts, and while it annoys the hell out of me, I also think, How can I complain when I’m still doing so well?’ Well, quite. By any yardstick, Sherman is pretty close to the top of the tree: number five this year on the major-exhibition-derived Kunstkompass rankings; number ten on the list of most expensive living American artists; number three on the list of most expensive living female artists. \n\nAuction prices are, of course, a dismal barometer of merit – so how about popular status? Sherman’s is such that one fan issued a free set of emojis, allowing Cindyphiles to communicate in her image. As for legacy, the Pictures Generation is now looked to as the spiritual forebear of the post-Internet generation as it grapples with a sea of rapidly proliferating, authorless images, the lack of disconnect between advertising and selfexpression, and the increasing commodification of self-image. Sherman has become an informal patron saint to every artist attempting to undermine the selfie or turn Instagram to her own purposes. If anyone can smash that glass ceiling, she’ll be the one to do it.",

It also raises an interesting question: is art power institutional or individual? \n\nWill the new director have to earn Pacquement’s longtime lock on a top-20 spot on this list, or does it come with the job? One thing is clear: the centre’s central importance to contemporary art is not likely to slip much, and Alain Seban, a politically appointed functionary when he took over as the centre’s president in 2007, and now a very astute and aggressively hands-on art player on his own terms, will maintain a high ranking, alone or accompanied.",

Well get in the queue, because the performance artist’s exhibition schedule is booked to 2024. Abramović is famous enough to be lampooned by Cate Blanchett in a forthcoming Netflix comedy (‘Waiting for the Artist’, an episode of the Documentary Now! series screening next year) and attacked by an artist (a man smashed a portrait of Abramović over the artist’s head in September). Nor does the artist need to be present to make herself felt: the Marina Abramović Institute is increasingly active, staging, for example, eight performances by artists using her ‘method’ at this year’s Bangkok Art Biennale.",

The Albertina in Vienna staged his largest retrospective to date; while Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, had a smaller exhibition [https://artreview.com/how-to-be-a-real-artist-walter-benjamin-adorno-herzog-ai-weiwei-nathan-fielder/]; and his gothic La Commedia Umana (at more than 8-by-6 metres, one of the largest Murano glass sculptures ever made) hung in Venice’s San Giorgio Maggiore during the Biennale. Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

While the effects of that remain to be seen, she nevertheless managed to develop a programme at the Stedelijk that navigates seamlessly between her usual focus on art’s next hot young thing and reexaminations of work by more mature practitioners, as recent shows for Jana Euler and Jordan Wolfson, but also Jean Tinguely and Ed van der Elsken, demonstrate. Furthermore, Ruf’s strength has always been her ability to operate as a meta-curator, in various advisory and panellist roles. In January, she launched the first Verbier Art Summit around the question of whether museums should consider ‘de-growth’, and she continues to be one of the core advisers\u2028to Luma Arles.",

            "It has been a turbulent 12 months since the head of the four Tate galleries took the number one spot on this list. While discontent and protest ﬁtfully surfaced from the activist-left over BP’s corporate sponsorship, in the spring it was Serota’s detractors on the right who made the most noise. The conservative press gleefully stretched for Oscar Wilde clichés when Tate lost not one but two directors in quick succession. Was it carelessness on Serota’s part? Perhaps not, but Penelope Curtis leaving Tate Britain for Calouste Gulbenkian Museum after a much maligned ﬁve-year tenure, and Chris Dercon announcing his decision to jump ship from Tate Modern to direct Berlin’s Volksbühne (although he’ll be staying in the post until next summer) was not a good look for Serota. \n\nThe ten-storey extension, which dwarfs Tate Modern’s original building like a super cruiseliner on the Venetian skyline, is proving controversial too. Currently four years behind its original opening date – during which performance spaces in the power station’s old oil tanks, opened to much hype in 2012, have sat idle as construction continues above them – the additional space is still missing £30m of funding, although Serota says he is conﬁdent this will be found before the new launch date of June 2016. Last year’s top spot came in recognition of Tate’s vast international network of global acquisitions committees and internationally active curatorial teams. No change there. Nor has all the construction dented its exhibition programme (Tanks aside) and general popularity with punters: a(nother) record – 7.9 million visits across all four sites in 2014–15, with 5.7 million alone stepping into Tate Modern. But with his legacy projects nearing completion, is the sixty-nine-year-old eyeing retirement in some pleasant corner of Southern England?.  ",

            "For the past few years the press has been speculating on seventy-nine-year-old Larry Gagosian’s succession plans for what is regularly estimated as a business with a $1 billion annual turnover (accumulated through the sale of works by the likes of Nan Goldin [https://artreview.com/artist/nan-goldin/], Carol Bove and Richard Prince [https://artreview.com/richard-prince-clearview-ai-and-your-face-gagosian/], who each had a show this year in at least one of Gagosian’s 19 galleries around the world). There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
