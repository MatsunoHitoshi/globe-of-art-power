            "The Ellipse Foundation opened in October 2006, having been established in 2004 and largely financed by the collector Dr João Oliveira-Rendeiro, chairman of Lisbon’s Banco Privado, along with a group of 20 other collector/investors hailing from Portugal, Spain and Brazil. The shopping list, however, is chiefly in the hands of Pedro Lapa, Alexandre Melo and Manuel Gonzalez, the three curators brought on board to spend the investors’ millions. And they’ve splurged on contemporary art’s biggest stars: Gabriel Orozco, Mona Hatoum, Jeff Wall, Thomas Hirschhorn, Stan Douglas, Douglas Gordon, Cindy Sherman, Sarah Lucas, Rodney Graham,Thomas Scheibitz, Richard Prince, Jimmie Durham, along with a hearty dose of Portuguese artists. This collection feels a bit sprawling and unfocused, but the curators are happy to admit that it is not about a specific strand of contemporary art. Only when you visit the foundation – a 20,000 square-foot space that looks like a black bunker across the road from a BMW dealership in an industrial park on the outskirts of sleepy resort town Cascais – you may wonder about purpose of it. “I want to create a major collection for Portugal and put Portugal and Cascais on the international scene”, says Rindeiro-Oliveiro, stating his worthy ambition.",

            "ArtReview: What is Google?\n\nGoogle: Google, a popular search engine, is a tool for finding resources on the World Wide Web. Google scans web pages to find instances of the keywords you have entered in the search box.\n\nAR: How have you changed the world?\n\nG: Imagine life before all of the modern conveniences that we take for granted. Think about getting ready for your day without a hairdryer, an electric razor or a microwave. Imagine life with no TV, no cell phone, no five-disc CD changers, and (the unthinkable) no computer for communicating with your mentor! It is almost unbelievable to think that 50 years ago some families did not even have a television; now you might be hard pressed to find a household without a TV. Modern inventions have certainly changed the world. In this project, you will take a closer look at how times have changed. Let’s get started!\n\nAR: How do you cope with such responsibility?\n\nG: Aligned to the lower tax proposal, ACT also wants to reduce or remove some Government programmes which they see as unnecessary and wasteful and increase self-reliance by encouraging individuals to take responsibility to pay for services traditionally paid for by Government. Critics point out that those with greater wealth would tend to cope with such self-reliance, whereas those with lower income with have fewer choices.\n\nAR: Do you believe in absolute truth?\n\nG: Learn to ask scientific questions. (How do you know what you are saying is true? What are the implications if you are right? And if you are wrong? How does this view impact your view of human life? Of religion? What factors – books, experiences, people, logic – led you to believe this? Why did you come to this conclusion and not the alternative?) All of us are at different stages in our understanding and experience, so realise that you don’t have to “win” every conversation. Just try to influence a person to the “next step” – and make sure you also are willing to take a next step, if necessary. Know that most people haven’t thought through what they believe, and so the real task is getting people to think on their own, not just swallow your ideas because you are more persuasive than the next guy.\n\nAR: Are you really democratic?\n\nG: Do you really, actually think Colbert was praising Bush?\n\nAR: What do you say to your critics?\n\nG: But as Texans like us say, when you find yourself in a hole, first thing to do is quit … You got more than enough critics right now, and sure, every dog …\n\nAR: Do you encourage sloppy research?\n\nG: Grade tough on homework, easier on time-bound tests. Frequently it happens in reverse: almost anything goes on the homework, which causes the students to get sloppy, and then they get clobbered on tests for making the same careless errors they got away with on the homework. This is pedagogically unsound, not to mention unfair.\n\nAR: How do you know so much so quickly?\n\nG: I bought the birthday hats and the inflatable beer bin for a party at my house, both items are extremely brilliant!! The service was fantastic, and the items delivered really quickly, so I could organise my party with ease. Thank you so much, I will definitely use this site again.\n\nAR: Where is the current hotbed of creativity?\n\nG: East Midlands is a hotbed of creativity!\n\nAR: What will be the next big thing in art?\n\nG: The Fred Flare Show.\n\nAR: Who is the best artist in the whole wide world?\n\nG: Dude, I got in a massive best person in the whole wide world. 2. You suck at the Internet!\n\nAR: Who is number one in the Power 100?\n\nG: I will never build only one of anything important. All important systems will have redundant control panels and power supplies. For the same reason I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all times.",

His book S,M,L,XL, a 1995 collaboration with graphic designer Bruce Mau, remains one of the most important architectural publications of recent times, and even if the 2003 compilation Content, was no where near as good, Koolhaas continues to push our understanding of contemporary culture with essays such as ‘Junk Space’. Although OMA are currently working on a series of large-scale projects such as the CCTV building in China, it’s no surprise that Koolhaas’s major impact on the art world is as a thinker rather than a doer: his analysis of contemporary museum culture featured in last year’s Venice Biennale, while this year, having designed its summer pavilion, he co-curated a 24-hour lecture marathon at London’s Serpentine Gallery.",

          content:
            "Jean-Marc Bustamante has no doubt where the power lies in French art, and that is with Marcel Duchamp. A loping fifty-four-year-old, he ponders the problem with a good-natured frown. “The trouble is, French artists – César, Bertrand Lavier and the rest – they went for the Duchamp of the readymade,” broods Bustamante, in London for a show of his latest work at the Timothy Taylor Gallery. “Not Duchamp the alchemist, Duchamp the surrealist, Duchamp the magicien. In America, Robert Gober and Paul McCarthy, they are fascinated by the difficult Duchamp, the one who went to Pasadena. But today, the French can’t cope with this kind of baroquisme. French art has become obsessed with ideas. They don’t like painting, they don’t like trash.”\n\nBustamante knows what he’s talking about. He is currently in the throes of curating his third and final Printemps de Septembre in Toulouse, a visual arts festival that, under his tenure, has become noticeably riskier and more outward looking. Printemps 2006 includes the first ever showing in France of Sarah Lucas’s work, for example – her particularly impolite Complete Arsehole series. If you take Bustamante’s two-Duchamps line, then Lucas falls heavily into the Gober camp.This isn’t cérébrale art and, Printemps’ curator maintains, it’s the kind of art that couldn’t be made in France today.\n\nYoung French artists have no fire in their belly, he says, and it is because the creaking cultural panoply of the French state – the FRACs and CNAPs – have spoilt them.With guaranteed studio space, five years’ free tuition and endless regional galleries to snap up their work, French art students are lazy. “You only had to go to La force de l’art [a show of contemporary French art at the Grand Palais this May] to see what I mean,” shrugs Bustamante. “Everyone included, every artist given the same amount of space; égalité in precisely the wrong sense. I’m French, I like the idea of the cultural exception; but…”.\n\nTeaching as he does at the École des Beaux Arts, Bustamante has seen the French art world from three sides. (“Until Printemps, I thought I was a difficult artist,” he beams, ruefully. “Now I’ve been a curator, I’m not so sure.”) His view at the end of all this is that power in French art lies increasingly with the grandes marquises: the owners of big-name fashion and luxury goods brands like François Pinault and agnès b.\n\n“With globalisation, the art scene has changed a lot, even in France,” Bustamante says. “Critics and dealers are a bit lost – where is the good art? China? Which art can we believe in now? Before, taste was determined by the closed world of the state. Now that world is not so secure.” Into this breach have stepped enormously rich collectors like Pinault, used to global markets and international brand making. The result has been an overlap between fashion and art that Bustamante sees as deeply destructive.\n\n“When you look at Pinault’s collection, it’s not really his,” he says. “He has people advising him, buying for him – it’s all to do with fashion. What happened was that about five years ago, Emmanuel Perrotin [owner of the Paris gallery of that name] decided to deal with Pinault and that kind of client. Before, if you went to openings at Paris galleries, they were full of sad, ugly people. Now it’s all beautiful boys, beautiful girls. These days, it’s no longer a problem if you go to Papa and say, ‘I want to go to art school’ – it’s seen as a high-earning career, like banking. But serious artists – good artists among my students – they are in real trouble.”\n\nSo where does French art go from here? Bustamante shrugs. “It’s difficult. Artists have to be charming, seductive, effective and good. People seem to have forgotten about the last of these.” He pauses for a minute, then says: “There’s a growing pressure now on young artists to succeed straight away. Up until now, the artist’s career has been very long. Now, with all this fashion and zapping, maybe that will change. It could be that an artist will now have a professional life of five or ten years. I hope not, eh? I mean, I’m fifty-four and I want to go on working.”",

Dia’s old Chelsea home on 22nd street sits empty (poor air conditioning was never a good reason to abandon that wonderful space), and its potential replacement in the meatpacking district still hasn’t been secured. Still, Dia:Beacon, the sublime 31-acre outpost one hour up the Hudson River, continues to be a beloved new pilgrimage for Manhattanites since it opened in 2003. They’re even considering a 70,000-square-foot expansion of this already gargantuan space. This year Cooke curated a well-received show at Beacon by Agnes Martin and received an award for curatorial excellence from Bard College. Together with Dia, she provides a welcome bit of calm relief from the normal museum frenzy in New York.",

His words are testament to a design practice that moves beyond merely providing vessels in which others programme, to a far more in-depth approach to museum building. It’s apparent too in the new home he is creating for the storied Studio Museum in Harlem, having honed his understanding of the needs of an institution dedicated to Black thinking and experience not least during the 2016 build of his National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC. Meanwhile, in the UK, Adjaye Associates worked with Theaster Gates to realise the artist’s Serpentine Pavilion, Black Chapel [https://artreview.com/can-theaster-gates-black-chapel-speak-to-a-ravaged-britain/].",

            "One potential franchise collapses, another rises elsewhere. It’s been a pretty standard year for Thomas Krens, director, brand-builder and relentless expander of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Soon after the Hong Kong government abandoned plans for a massive cultural centre that the Guggenheim was hoping to fill, Abu Dhabi announced that it will build an estimated $200 million Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim within five years. And Krens is still pursuing new venues in Singapore and Mexico. In another sense, the last couple of years have been ones of sober reorganisation for the Guggenheim empire: Krens stepped up and away from the New York Guggenheim to focus on new destinations and promoted long-term protégé Lisa Dennison to direct the day-to-day running of the original headquarters. Ms Dennison immediately promised to strengthen the permanent collection (implicit acknowledgement that, as critics said, it had indeed been neglected under Krens?) and appointed the Guggenheim’s first ever curator of photography, Jennifer Blessing.",

Nevertheless, last year they represented Britain at the Venice Biennale, and followed that this year with a show of their new SONOFAGOD PICTURES at White Cube. Currently they have a show at the Kunsthalle in Tübingen and February next year could herald the arrival of a veritable Neo-Georgian era: the pair are to be the first living artists to be given the entirety of Tate Modern’s fourth-floor space for a thorough survey reaching right back to 1971. They will publish a two-volume catalogue raisonné, containing every picture they have created over that period spread over 1,200 pages, and then the show will tour to Munich, Turin, San Francisco and Milwaukee, concluding in Brooklyn in 2009.",

Founded by artist Maurizio Cattelan and editors-cum-curators Massimiliano Gioni and Ali Subotnick, this non-commercial space showed the work of over 40 international bigshots in its three year run from 2002 to 2005, and was temporarily rehoused this year at both Tate Modern and the Whitney Biennial. This year the trio behind this gallery-as-a-work-of-art showed their mettle, curating the Berlin Biennial, with Cattelan proving wrong those who claimed an artist shouldn’t curate.",

In what has become an exemplary career marked by the lucid prose of his catalogue essays – something all too rarely encountered these days – and the discriminating and sympathetic eye with which he puts together exhibitions, he has consistently raised the bar high, and then vaulted over it. From MoMA, he went on to curate the SITE Santa Fe Biennial and become a professor of art at New York University. One might call him the leading intellectual of contemporary art – our answer to Bernard Berenson. This year, however, he has surpassed even his own high-water mark. Named Dean of the Yale School of Art, in 2007 he will also become the first American ever to hold the post of Director of the Venice Biennale.",

Keller will be leaving this behemoth to run the Fondation Beyeler: a small-ish modern art museum in his hometown, that is most famous for showing Bacons and Cézannes alongside primitive artworks. Keller denies that he is deserting Mammon for the god of public art, insisting that “Art Basel isn’t just Sam Keller, it’s a whole team” and that the Renzo Piano-designed Beyeler is “one of the world’s most beautiful museums of modern art”. Whether Art Basel’s sponsors will share his enthusiasm remains to be seen.",

He opened a second space in Berlin in 1992, but remained focused on Leipzig art. This was a canny decision, as interest in this school of art has since exploded: stable artists such as Neo Rauch (whose works were part of a big show this year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Tim Eitel (who recently showed at the gallery in Leipzig and previously at PaceWildenstein in New York) command solo shows as well as high prices.",

Mark Titchner, whom he represents in his LA gallery, Peres Projects, was nominated for the Turner Prize last year, and the prolific Koh has been gaining critical acclaim for his romantic homoerotic performances, sculptures and photographs. In 2005 Peres opened a second space in Berlin – which showed mostly US artists and a few German ones – and throughout this summer he ran a project space in Athens (it coincided with the 1st Athens Biennial, and closes this month). Peres, as he will point out, is more than a dealer, and collaborates with his artists in gleeful, campy celebrations of all things priapic – for instance, the journal Daddy or, with Koh, the Asian Song Society (aka, ASS), a project space in New York that opened in 2006 with the exhibition Future Cock. Though his artists are enjoying what might be a career peak, especially on the biennial circuit, perhaps the future will see something new from Peres.",

He boasts partnerships in the Kantor/Feuer Gallery in LA and in London’s recently established Brown Gallery, run by his former director Kimberly Brown, and in 2002 was a co-founder of NADA, the New Art Dealers Alliance, which operates a satellite fair during Art Basel Miami Beach. Much interest focused on Feuer, naturally, is directed at his list of artists, and his stable – which includes Dana Schutz, Jules de Balincourt and Anton Henning – is as young, promising and publicityfriendly as he is. Schutz, for example, is widely discussed in New York for her reinvigoration of largescale, colour-soaked painting, and a number of Feuer’s artists showed work in the American art surveys – both Saatchi’s and the Serpentine’s – that opened in London last year. It seems only a matter of months before the ‘relative newcomer’ graduates to ‘veteran dealer’.",

The foundation, developed on the site of a disused factory in the district of La Bastille, is dedicated to staging contemporary exhibitions of work from other collections. Shows are organised by independent curators, though always in keeping with the forward-thinking ethos of the foundation’s founder, who previously launched a contemporary art gallery in Grenoble. This year de Galbert broke his own protocol and exhibited works from his own collection: artists shown ranged from gelitin and Hans Belmer to Yayoi Kusama and Erwin Wurm, and the foundation also recently mounted the first show in France of Japanese Neo-Dadaist Tetsumi Kudo.",

Carlos de la Cruz, a Havana-born businessman and head of Eagle Brands, and his wife Rosa are major collectors of contemporary and especially Latin American art. They have collected and championed in their vast homecum-viewing-space works by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Guillermo Kuitca (both strongly represented at this year’s Venice Biennale), assume vivid astro focus and Gabriel Orozco, among others. Famous for hosting lavish 700-guest dinner parties that kick-start Art Basel Miami Beach in December, the de la Cruz home, in Biscayne Bay, is a Mecca for artworld VIPs and ‘ordinary’ people alike – anyone can visit provided they have made an appointment. In 2004, the de la Cruzes launched the 10,000-square-foot Moore Space in Miami’s Design District, now a must-visit on the Art Basel Miami Beach public programme. Popular with artists and institutions (they recently donated work by John Bock, Philippe Parreno and Pierre Huyghe to Miami MoCA and Tate) the de la Cruzes have been vital to the promotion of Miami as a centre for contemporary art.\n\n",

            "One of the biggest icons of 1980s German Neo-expressionism, Anselm Kiefer has built on the successes of last year with a crescendo of major exhibitions in 2007. After museum shows in Montreal and San Francisco, Kiefer hit his stride this year with a major solo show at White Cube Mason’s Yard. Aperiatur Terra furthered the sixty-two-yearold artist’s interest in the symbolic and the mythological, drawing on Biblical texts alluding to the coming of Christ to produce a massive installation of painting and sculpture. Kiefer scored a simultaneous hit with the architectural sculpture Jericho, two tottering towers of reinforced concrete that dominated the courtyard of the nearby Royal Academy of Arts; allegorical echoes of the Twin Towers merging with the blasted aesthetics of countless conflict zones. Aperiatur Terra has since toured to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney. Since then, the Guggenheim Bilbao has hosted a massive six-month retrospective of Kiefer’s work, during which time he has managed to fill the atrium of Paris’s Grand Palais with an installation of truly apocalyptic proportions. This autumn sees the opening of a special commission at the Louvre. Now the question could be; can Kiefer’s work get any bigger?",

In their Frankfurt headquarters – two tall skyscrapers – the German bank have devoted each floor to a German artist, in descending order of their birth. As you go down the lift, you go forward in art history, from Beuys to Baselitz, Becher to Nicolai. Germans, eh? The British headquarters, meanwhile, shows British artists alongside German ones – a Freud room, a Struth room, for example – and the US shows American artists with their German counterparts. As much as the size of their corporate collection – which is overseen by Alistair Hicks and comprises 50,000 works of art (Deutsche Bank collect museum-scale pieces but much of this number is in works on paper) – Deutsche Bank are known for being active sponsors of exhibitions, biennials and institutions. In this past year, they sponsored the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, where Isa Genzken showed her installation Oil, as well as the Istanbul and inaugural Athens biennials. They have also been the but art critics who can express their own opinions in a clear and concise manner are rarer still. Beyond the glitzy world of glossy magazines and awards, Saltz managed to maintain his ongoing campaign for more equality between men and women in the artworld (while gallantly admitting to ArtReview that his wife, Roberta Smith, was more equal than him when it came to this list), to let off a broadside against what he calls ‘Biennial Culture’ and um… to continue to bash the Guggenheim’s Thomas Krens.",

In 2006 they entered into a threeyear partnership with Tate Modern in London, where, as part of the museum’s rehang, UBS will exhibit key parts of their collection in the London gallery. In 2006 Tate showed the UBS photography collection, which includes iconic work such as Andreas Gursky’s photograph of a convenience store, 99 Cent (1999), and this past year showed its drawing collection (closing this month). The partnership follows on ones already in place in other museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, which allow the bank to share its collection with the wider public. The policy, at least in the case of Tate Modern, has raised concerns about using publicly funded gallery space to show a corporate collection, but the scheme does suggest that each museum will get at least some of the works shown. UBS’s advisory team includes Yoshiko Mori, who co-founded the Mori Art Museum in Japan, and the veteran curator Jean-Christophe Ammann.",

The next 12 months look equally good. First up is De Salvo’s retrospective of Lawrence Weiner, opening this month, while the 2008 Whitney Biennial, curated by Henriette Huldisch together with Momin, will again be one of the big events in the art calendar.

He’s already changed his name (from Goldberg), driven a delivery truck, served in the US Army, made a guest appearance in an episode of The Simpsons, designed a line of jewellery for Tiffany’s, been the subject of a feature film, hung out with Brad Pitt and launched a software division, Gehry Technologies, so that architects around the world can be more like him. But the original ‘starchitect’ has never been one to sit back. During the past year he’s seen the unveiling of his first building in New York, collaborated on an exhibition with longtime friend Sophie Calle and launched his plans for the latest $200-million branch of the Guggenheim franchise in Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, work continues on Bernard Arnault’s Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation, due to open by 2010 and located in Paris’s Bois de Boulogne, which Gehry claims will ‘symbolise France’s devotion to culture’. Just as much, presumably, as it symbolises the artworld big-hitters’ continuing devotion to Gehry.",

Yet Phillips’s success continues to lie in its image as the more cutting-edge auction house, selling work by the likes of Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy. It’s also an image supported by its very visible owner, Simon de Pury, former chairman of Sotheby’s Europe, who recently produced a compilation album, Saturday@Phillips, and brought the splashy Hip Hop’s Crown Jewels to his salerooms. His standing as an auctioneer was further underlined this summer when he was the focus of artist Julius Friedman’s film project Make It Rain, screened at Patrick Painter in LA, which pointed to de Pury as a rainmaker extraordinaire. When you consider that the company has been running for just more than a decade and is the third most successful auction house in the world, Friedman’s choice of subject seems perfectly natural.",

Yet with so many new exhibitions, and ones that don’t so much open as pop up out of nowhere, the megagallery is turning into a programmatically confusing space.

This split personality has been on view in the artist’s exhibitions this past year, from his wrapping of the Hong Kong Museum of Art to appearing at the cool beating heart of the exhibition Sonic Youth Etc.: Sensational Fix. Auction prices for his work have plummeted, and he’s being sued for alleged copyright infringements, but Prince has been on display where it matters most: at the Met, in The Pictures Generation; Gagosian Madison Avenue, in a solo show; and not least Pinault’s new Dogana space in Venice.",

            "Whatever your opinion of Charles Saatchi, his approach to the artworld is never boring. While his relaunched Saatchi Gallery has been cranking out voluminous attention-grabbing shows from the collection, the former ad man has found time to author an art-school realityshow contest, knock out a second book of quitefunny answers to interview questions and once more ruffle the official art establishment’s feathers, this time with an offer to donate his collection to the nation. In July, Saatchi announced plans to turn his gallery into ‘MoCA London’, gifting £25m of work to the UK, but the Arts Council has reportedly baulked at the condition that the gallery be able to sell from the collection to fund acquisitions. As we await the next chapter, Saatchi is still, entertainingly, throwing his weight around.",

            "For the New York Times’s senior art critic, 2010 has been about staying abreast of the gallery and museum scene’s postcrunch vagaries while keeping a calm eye on the latest developments in art itself. Smith has taken a pragmatic, hopeful approach to recession trends – giving a cautious welcome to the appointment of New York gallerist Jeffrey Deitch as the new director of crisis-ridden MOCA LA, for example. In terms of art criticism, among her standout commentaries was the assertion that painting isn’t dead; she has also been taking to task the ‘squeaky-clean, well-made, intellectually decorous’ products of fashionable postminimalism and Eurokunst ‘relational aesthetics’. Mildly conservative, pluralist and suspicious of hotheaded extremes, Smith remains the Big Apple’s bastion of responsible art criticism.",

So here you are, Jerry, comfortably nestled between Victoria Miro and the Zabludowiczes. Saltz’s artworld power is a slippery thing this year, given that he’s spent much of it cultivating mass appeal – both through his appearances as a judge on the Bravo reality contest Work of Art (2010) and in the slow buildup of his Facebook and Twitter tribes. Whether this populist approach has diluted his critical standing within the industry is not yet clear: he’s certainly picked some fights in his postings – with Robert Storr (over the Guggenheim’s YouTube biennial) and Klaus Biesenbach (calling the latter ‘a dick’ for his ‘pretty boring program’) – but made a lot more friends in doing so: 3,963 at last Facebook count.",

One was at the Museum der Bildenden Künste in his hometown of Leipzig – a city now as famous for the school of painting Rauch pioneered as it is for being the final resting place of J.S. Bach ­– the other at the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich. Commenting on the honour, news service Deutsche Welle barked, ‘He is one of the country’s most important living painters, and a de facto ambassador for modern German art’. On the commercial side, with Rauch’s work breaking its record price at auction (his 1999 painting Stellwerk sold for £892,450 in December), the artist is busy giving it away: donating 40 works on paper ­with a value of $130,000 to Aschersleben, the city of his grandparents. Rauch has promised to follow this initial bundle by giving away all subsequent work in the same medium to the city, with a view to a permanent exhibition opening there in spring 2012.",

The move has seen Birnbaum shedding his previous commitments left, right and centre, resigning as rector of the influential Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main and as director of the exhibition space Portikus in the same city this April, both of which positions he’d held since 2001, as well as making an exit from the board of Manifesta, on which he’d sat since 2002. That said, he found time between CV-building to sit on various juries, including Victor Pinchuk’s Future Generation Art Prize and the inaugural Absolut Art Award, which he chaired – and which was won by Keren Cytter, a favourite of Birnbaum’s. And he remains one of the most erudite philosophers to tackle aesthetics and contemporary art practice.",

And he was briefly a significant owner of Sotheby’s stock, during which time 20 works from his collection were shown by the auction house (whatever the agreement there, when the stock rose sharply a short time later, Cohen promptly dumped it). This year, among other purchases, Cohen acquired a 1958 Jasper Johns Flag painting for a reported $110m. Still, it’s a shame when you’re so busy you can’t enjoy your own collection. He recently mentioned retiring to ‘just watch a fucking movie, or hang with my kids’. OK, he forgot to mention ‘and stare at the fucking Flag’, but we’re pretty sure he meant that, too.",

Once they’ve pulled on their wellies, however, it turns out that Wirth and his wife, Manuela Hauser, are ready to get down with both the mud and the cultural enrichment of his new ’hood. Hauser & Wirth Somerset – a converted seventeenth-century farmhouse and grounds, featuring multiple free-to-enter galleries, outdoor artworks and a buzzy restaurant – opened in July to general artworld approval, but perhaps more importantly, with a neighbourhood-pleasing programme of talks, workshops and site-relevant residencies. How this commitment to grassroots engagement will evolve to fit the decidedly more urban terrain of downtown LA when the 9,300sqm Hauser Wirth & Schimmel opens for business next year remains to be seen.",

Works from the collection are now an almost constant presence in the Benaki Museum, Athens, for instance, where this year Joannou cocurated a survey of work by the late Greek sculptor George Lappas. In June, while artist Roberto Cuoghi and his team were kiln-firing dozens of ceramic crabs as part of the artist’s Deste commission on Hydra, The Equilibrists opened at the Benaki, featuring a survey of young Greek art selected from open submission and through a hundred studio visits by New Museum curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Massimiliano Gioni. The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer – False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober – all owned by Joannou. ",

The gallery, one of the founding members of the Gallery Climate Coalition (a nonprofit launched in October with the aim of developing an industry-wide response to the climate crisis) has long been making sales ‘based purely on images’, Logsdail junior told Forbes, and as such the disruption wasn’t going to faze them: an online screening and exhibition programme launched in May. They did however open a galley in the Hamptons, where many monied New Yokers chose to sit out lockdown, and quickly set a sales record for Stanley Whitney, selling a painting for $850,000. Likewise, with the physical Frieze art fair in London cancelled, Lisson opened a new temporary space in Mayfair (leased until March). While London and New York City went in and out of lockdowns, the gallery’s one-year-old Shanghai premises staged shows for Shirazeh Houshiary and Julian Opie, with the latter launching multiple public art projects in the city.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "Just as you were the settling in to read last November’s Power 100 issue, Gorvy, the chairman and international head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s auction house, saw his New York saleroom hammer down Francis Bacon’s triptych Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) for $142.4m (£88.3m), the most expensive contemporary artwork ever sold at auction. That figure, along with the current vogue among collectors for paying high prices at auction for new works by very young artists, goes perhaps a little way towards accounting for the fact that sales of contemporary art now account for close to half of all auction business. For Gorvy, it’s booming, and with new collectors flooding in there’s no sign of a bust in sight. In a market like this one, and when your auction house is top of the food chain – Christie’s had record sales of just under £800m in the first six months of 2014, a rise of 20 percent over the same period in 2013 – you’re going to have to move jobs before you’ll be off this list.",

In September L&M Arts launched a new gallery at a former power plant in Venice, with local hero Paul McCarthy’s first gallery exhibition in his hometown in more than a decade. Speaking of the move, Lévy recently stated that she ‘felt that the old, postwar pole of Paris–New York had become Berlin–Los Angeles’. Like many of the galleries that have been able to expand through the recent economic chaos, Lévy and Mnuchin (a former equities trader and director of the New York Stock Exchange) split their operation between the secondary and primary markets, with the LA space their biggest statement yet of an intention to dominate the latter in the way they already dominate the former.",

She has established herself as a major collector, increasingly internationally, with an eye (helped by a curatorial team) for what fits with her and husband Poju’s London-based private institution (together with a space on Broadway in New York and a residency programme on an island in Poju’s native Finland). In September Anita told The New York Times, ‘We prefer artists who like to work on longterm projects with institutions. The get-richquick painters are another story.’ So no ‘crapstraction’, then. This policy is borne out in their shows over the past year, including Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch (on now), Michael E. Smith, Adriano Costa, Heather Phillipson and, from an older generation, Albert Oehlen. Over in Finland hotshots Caragh Thuring, Sam Falls and Nicolas Deshayes holed up on the island to make work, as various vIps stopped by to take a peek.   ",

Headquartered in Shanghai, the gallery came out of hibernation ready to dominate the city’s art scene during the last quarter of 2020, with its A-listers getting an impressive airing. Xue Song showed at Powerlong Museum, Yang Zhenzhong at Rén Space, Zhang Enli at Power Station of Art, Zhu Jia at Modern Art Base and Yang Fudong at HOW Art Museum – all in the same month! But Shanghart is not all about the Chinese-Male-Artist-of-a-Certain-Age. At its own M50 space is Under the Sign of Saturn, a group show featuring three young female artists from Guangzhou – Qin Jin, Chen Dandizi and Lin Yuqi – demonstrating its commitment to supporting new voices from outside the typical centres of art production.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "The California-born naturalised Brit made two significant gestures with his Venice Biennale, slimming the number of artists down to 83 (from 120 in 2017) and asking each of them to present works in both the Arsenale and Giardini. May You Live in Interesting Times was too Western-centric for some – almost a third of the artists were based in the US – but the overall critical consensus was a pretty solid ‘B’. ‘Intermittent bursts of urgency and the occasional surprise’ was the verdict of Adrian Searle in The Guardian, while Jason Farago admired the artist list in The New York Times but felt that Rugoff had nonetheless played it ‘safe’. Meanwhile, Zoé Whitley joined Rugoff’s Hayward Gallery from the Tate (and fresh off curating the British Pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale). Whatever the critics thought of Venice, Rugo can count on one fan: in June, he was awarded an OBE by the Queen.",

As controversy over a slated Brussels outpost rumbles on (in Belgium’s domestic politics, at least), the museum’s temporary project space in Málaga has been extended by five years. Back in France, the museum announced a 22,000sqm ‘art factory’ in the city’s suburbs while in February the museum’s original foray outside the fourth arrondissement, the Centre Pompidou-Metz, staged a Lee Ufan show. In Paris, the mothership this summer hosted an exhibition of new works by Cao Fei, making her – right on time – the first Chinese artist to hold a solo show at the institution.",

Mobile Homestead (2010), an ambitious public project that will see a replica of his childhood home make a journey from midtown Detroit to the suburbs where Kelley grew up, is the artist’s first public project anywhere in the world to result in a permanent installation. It’s proof of his continuing ability to remain on the perceived fringes while creating work that is undeniably significant, and which has a wide and lasting influence.",

(Given this supportive emphasis, it’s unsurprising that Philbin describes the Hammer’s primary audience as artists.) Though region-based selections may have their problems, in a period in which there are fears about the homogenisation of the LA museums (due to the growing powers of Eli Broad and MOCA), the Hammer and LAXART will help to guarantee a strong home–city scene.",

And it’s really hard to imagine that they could not have expected the pasting the design got from public and critics alike.\n\nKapoor’s last foray into architecture, a train station with Future Systems in Naples, has only been completed this year, two years later than planned, but there’ll be no chance of lateness in London, with an Olympic deadline looming. And there’s no doubting Kapoor’s popularity: in addition to a solo show at the Guggenheim Bilbao, his Royal Academy exhibition (the first granted to a living British artist) got 277,473 visitors, making it into the top three of London contemporary art shows last year. It’s a pulling power that few of his peers can match.",

            "Luc Tuymans is increasingly happy to fire shots at the artworld. Last year he bemoaned that ‘having a network’ was being confused with being a good curator (something which will be tested by his curating of a James Ensor show at the Royal Academy, London, this month). This year he told the Brooklyn Rail that ‘a good painting is a bad painting in a photograph’, a broadside perhaps to the kind of abstraction that is being traded over Instagram. He played on the relationship between the canvas and the lens further with a series of works debuted at Zeno X in September, a show marking 25 years of working with the Antwerp gallery. Insert I, II, III and IV are paintings of iPhone photographs of his own works that Tuymans shot during a 2013 solo show at the Menil Collection, Houston. Lenses of a different kind were a subject of his exhibitions at the Museum aan de Stroom (a homecoming gig) and currently at the National Portrait Gallery, London, featuring as their motif only his works that include spectacles.  ",

Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes. \n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there’s Slotover’s influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city’s East End.",

And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration – something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "Few museum appointments can have produced as much debate as the hiring of longtime New York gallerist and art impresario Deitch to the top position at LA MOCA. Why the surprise? If your entire art career has been about serving the interests of a particular group of artists and a particular group of collectors, can you really acquire overnight the disinterest that most people expect a museum director to pretend to have? But as those groups include the kind of people he’ll be asking to donate money to his new institution, there’s a certain logic to it all.\n\nDeitch’s energetic presence and savvy (an attentiongrabbing collaboration with actor James Franco, for example) are probably what the ailing MOCA needs right now: nearbankrupt after financial mismanagement and the credit-crunch caught up with it, MOCA was bailed out by a $30m donation plan from billionaire MOCA trustee Eli Broad.\n\nDeitch’s appointment probably won’t appease those who worry that Broad is too dominant on the LA art scene, or the artists who wonder why this museum director is hanging out with actors instead of seeing what’s happening in their studios, but when you’re on your knees, it’s hard to be too demanding. If Deitch makes a success of this, it may become a model other museums will want to follow.",

The UK-born artist, critic and curator took over at New York’s White Columns in 2004, bringing to it (and New York) his intuitive grasp of how art can mix pop culture, subculture and every culture that doesn’t count as lifelessly institutional. So while he’s plugged in and sought after (he’s founding curatorial adviser to New York’s Independent art fair, and could place a curated section based on the life of legendary dealer Hudson at Frieze New York in May), his appreciation of the maverick reaches far from artworld epicentres – with painter Peter Doig, Higgs organised a show of the overlooked Grenada-born British painter Denzil Forrester, in the artist’s home of Cornwall. White Columns, meanwhile, ranges widely (having moved to bigger premises in April) – from a show about punk icon Richard Hell to shows by artists who live with mental illness and disability. ",

Which means numerous exhibitions: at L&M Arts in New York, Gagosian in New York, Galería Hilario Galguera in New Mexico and Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum. This last retrospective not only found Hirst partying with Albert II, the principality’s crown prince; it also included spot, spin and butterfly paintings, all series which, he announced at the Gagosian show (entitled End of an Era), he would no longer be producing.\n\nThis may to some extent slow the shrinking of Hirst’s market – down by 93 percent last year and bound to be lower this annum – and allay the artist’s detractors, who in August reiterated and expanded on accusations of plagiarism. A charge Hirst branded ‘gibberish’. Still, Hirst isn’t one for cooling his heels. His Murderme art collection grows apace, his Other Criteria publishing wing and retail outlets continue to turn out books, sell multiples and support exhibitions – and he’s rumoured to have a longterm gig booked in: a Tate retrospective to coincide with London’s 2012 Olympics. ",

Still, a routine year for Enwezor nevertheless involved Performa’s annual gala being dedicated to him; officially this was for his catalytic role in raising the visibility of South African art, though the visibility of art from all of Africa and the diaspora would, surely, be very different without Enwezor’s evangelising over the 20 years since his first major curatorial project. Meanwhile, the typically ambitious programme he oversees at Munich’s Haus der Kunst included major monographic shows (James Casebere, Michael Buthe and an upcoming one by Joana Hadjithomas & Khalil Joreige), and the whopping global survey Postwar – Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic 1945–65. In January he signed on for another five years at HDK: a no-brainer on its part, though Enwezor will no doubt pop up in many other places too. ",

Broad (together with wife Edythe) wants to be the art angel in the City of Angels, creating press and fanfare whenever he gives. And give he undeniably does.\n\nThere are fears being voiced from LA’s art community that Broad is having a significant homogenising influence on the city’s museums. Press coverage of Broad is filled with sideswipes and barely concealed irritation on the part of patrons, curators and museum directors (except those he supports or those waiting for a cheque).\n\nThe truth is, however, that museums need Broad like never before: California has a 12 percent unemployment rate and a $20b deficit, and financial cuts are being made left, right and centre. Broad, with a fortune valued at $5.7b, has pledged to give 75 percent of it away. And the building of the Broad collection museum on Grand Avenue, designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which is now getting under way in earnest, should keep him busy for the time being.",

And other gallery artists continue to maintain a high profile. \n\nElmgreen & Dragset’s exhibitions in 2013 have included a yearlong public project in Munich’s main squares and a major site-specific installation in the old textile galleries at the V&A in London. Meanwhile the ever-popular and populist Grayson Perry becomes the first visual artist to deliver the BBC’s annual Reith Lectures. The recent addition of Kara Walker to the gallery’s roster won’t do any harm either. ",

Whether Museo Jumex offers that is yet to be seen: 2015 was a tumultuous year that saw accusations of censorship at the newly opened museum and the departure of its inaugural director. In the absence of a replacement being named, chief curator Julieta González continues to serve as interim director. It was perhaps an odd move too for a Mexican institution to take on a Guggenheim-curated touring show on Latin American art (Pablo León de la Barra’s Under the Same Sun), and the homegrown The Natural Order of Things received mixed reviews. Hosting solo shows for Jose Dávila and Walid Raad points to a welcome direction, however, for the man who remains one of Latin America’s most important collectors. ",

            "In the past 12 months the Murakami empire has been redesigning its global plan: in October 2012 came news of the closure of Kaikai Kiki Gallery Taipei, Hidari Zingaro Taipei and GEISAI Taipei (officially termed a ‘temporary break’ due to ‘a change in the gallery structure’); in Europe, Hidari Zingaro Berlin presented four exhibitions in 2012, but only one in 2013. However, as the head of Kaikai Kiki (the artist’s art production company), Murakami has successfully introduced his artists into the artworld. Murakami’s personal career is still flourishing: two solo gallery shows (in Hong Kong and LA) and one institutional show, Takashi in Superflat Wonderland, at Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul. His debut feature film, Jellyfish Eyes (2013), had its international premiere in April. And the Japanese makeup brand Shu Uemura has announced a cosmetics collection, titled Six Hearts Princes, based on Murakami’s 6HP anime project.",

For to be the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art involves a lot of fundraising and a head for figures. These are likely prefixed by dollar signs and suffixed by ‘million’: the $650m needed to complete LACMA’s teardown-and-rebuild capital project; the $117.5m Govan secured from LA County in April. Or they might refer to missing square metres, after it emerged that Peter Zumthor’s design will include 10 percent less area than the planned 36,000sqm. Or be attached to the deal with Budi Tek’s Yuz Museum, with which LACMA will partner on a jointly owned foundation managing 90 percent of the Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur’s collection. Govan knows that making art accessible in California requires an unholy alliance of number crunching and celebrity: hence roping in Kanye West to donate $10m to James Turrell’s decades-awaited Roden Crater.",

(Koons donated the concept, not the finished work; one critic called it a ‘poisoned chalice’.) Despite this, Koons remains undeterred, focusing on a series of bags being created with Louis Vuitton: a Mona Lisa backpack or a Rubens duffel, anyone? When it comes to an unruffled engagement with capitalism and the smoothest of productions, Koons remains king. ",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

            "This time last year, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art and chief auctioneer Meyer was bringing his gavel down in New York on the biggest single auction in its 269-year history, raking in $375 million, with Mark Rothko’s painting No. 1 (Royal, Red and Blue) (1954) going for $75m. By contrast, London sales throughout the year proved strong, if not earth-shattering, but for Westphal – chairman of contemporary art Europe – the auction game may be changing anyway: in October, Sotheby’s expanded its S/2 private sales gallery format from New York to London, effectively muscling in on the business of gallerists and private dealers.\n\nPrivate sales are a growth area for Sotheby’s, so S/2 London plans five selling shows a year. Sotheby’s shareholders seem to like it: the company’s shares have risen continuously, even while billionaire activist investor Dan Loeb has recently been gunning for Sotheby’s CEO William Ruprecht to step down.",

            "There are many reasons why Matthew Marks is a perennial figure on this list, but all of them come back to the artists the New York and LA gallerist works with. King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‘Artists… like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.’ His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who’s who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks’s skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive. ",

The buzzing beasties added to the sense of claustrophobia generated by standing led screens showing layered, flicking, nightmarish images derived by running data from MRI brain scans through neural imaging networks. Yet Huyghe’s joining of the dots between man, machine and nature has never been comfortable, as the residents of Okayama are now finding. As director of that city’s second art summit, Huyghe has roped in 17 (Western) artists and collectives including Matthew Barney and Lili Reynaud-Dewar to create an exhibition as ‘living entity’ through which to ‘navigate heterogeneous things, chemical and algorithmic processes, as well as different intelligent life forms’. If this sounds natural for an artist long associated with Relational Aesthetics, it makes sense that the man who coined the term, Nicolas Bourriaud, included Huyghe’s work in the group show inaugurating the curator’s Contemporary Art Center of Montpellier.",

Even when the reality is a headless corpse. In 2015 his work was everywhere. His 2013 Gramsci Monument project in the Bronx was the subject of a documentary film by Angelo A. Lüdin. \n\nHis immersive installation Nachwirkung (Aftermath) opened at the Kunsthalle Bremen and his collages transformed the project room of the MAN in Nuoro, Italy. His installation in the Central Pavilion of the Venice Biennale simulated the collapse of that structure’s roof, and he brought a similarly apocalyptic scenario to the South London Gallery, complete with a quotation that takes the work back to Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci: ‘Destruction is difficult, indeed it is as difficult as creation.’ Difficult for some.",

There were also shows for Alex Katz and Ella Kruglyanskaya in his Harlem space and Charlemagne Palestine and Laura Owens at his Rome outpost, while Karl Holmqvist joined the restaurant/gallery that Brown and Rirkrit Tiravanija run in upstate New York.

With locations in New York, Brussels and Seoul [https://artreview.com/gladstone-gallery-to-open-new-seoul-space/], and artists ranging from Matthew Barney [https://artreview.com/matthew-barney-secondary-no-pain-no-gain/] to Marisa Merz and Rachel Rose (all of whom had shows), as well as the likes of Rirkrit Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] and Sarah Lucas (who have had significant shows elsewhere this year), Gladstone has colossal spread. But sometimes trouble presents itself closer to home: a lawsuit by a former New York employee made its way through the courts.",

            "This year has been business as usual for the founder of White Cube, who focused on consolidating a growing empire following the opening of two new spaces, in Seoul and New York, last year (joining ones in London, Hong Kong and Paris). Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

            "As any Richter historian will tell you: trying to pinpoint a sense of style to the artist’s work is a task doomed to failure. For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter’s subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‘signature’ aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‘cult of personality’ he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‘It’s a frightening development,’ he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales – Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m – it’s been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman’s New York space in May). But his influence on painting globally remains big.  ",

            "Since 1977, when, after an early foray into multiples, she opened her New York gallery with a show by Marcel Broodthaers, Goodman has dedicated her considerable energies to promoting exchange between the American and European artworlds. She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

The conservative press gleefully stretched for Oscar Wilde clichés when Tate lost not one but two directors in quick succession. Was it carelessness on Serota’s part? Perhaps not, but Penelope Curtis leaving Tate Britain for Calouste Gulbenkian Museum after a much maligned ﬁve-year tenure, and Chris Dercon announcing his decision to jump ship from Tate Modern to direct Berlin’s Volksbühne (although he’ll be staying in the post until next summer) was not a good look for Serota. \n\nThe ten-storey extension, which dwarfs Tate Modern’s original building like a super cruiseliner on the Venetian skyline, is proving controversial too. Currently four years behind its original opening date – during which performance spaces in the power station’s old oil tanks, opened to much hype in 2012, have sat idle as construction continues above them – the additional space is still missing £30m of funding, although Serota says he is conﬁdent this will be found before the new launch date of June 2016. Last year’s top spot came in recognition of Tate’s vast international network of global acquisitions committees and internationally active curatorial teams. No change there. Nor has all the construction dented its exhibition programme (Tanks aside) and general popularity with punters: a(nother) record – 7.9 million visits across all four sites in 2014–15, with 5.7 million alone stepping into Tate Modern. But with his legacy projects nearing completion, is the sixty-nine-year-old eyeing retirement in some pleasant corner of Southern England?.  ",

            "‘An institution is a learning system’, Obrist told Forbes this year while discussing the ‘Year of AI’ at London’s Serpentine Galleries. Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
