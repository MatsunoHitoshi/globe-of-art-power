            "A former screenwriter and journalist, Koolhaas was once better known for his polemical writing on architecture (and, for the most part, culture in general) than for anything he and his practice OMA actually built. His book S,M,L,XL, a 1995 collaboration with graphic designer Bruce Mau, remains one of the most important architectural publications of recent times, and even if the 2003 compilation Content, was no where near as good, Koolhaas continues to push our understanding of contemporary culture with essays such as ‘Junk Space’. Although OMA are currently working on a series of large-scale projects such as the CCTV building in China, it’s no surprise that Koolhaas’s major impact on the art world is as a thinker rather than a doer: his analysis of contemporary museum culture featured in last year’s Venice Biennale, while this year, having designed its summer pavilion, he co-curated a 24-hour lecture marathon at London’s Serpentine Gallery.",

            "Robert Storr, who began as an artist and soon became a highly respected critic, was a curator for 12 years at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where he mounted seminal shows of Gerhard Richter, Chuck Close, Bruce Nauman, Robert Ryman and others. In what has become an exemplary career marked by the lucid prose of his catalogue essays – something all too rarely encountered these days – and the discriminating and sympathetic eye with which he puts together exhibitions, he has consistently raised the bar high, and then vaulted over it. From MoMA, he went on to curate the SITE Santa Fe Biennial and become a professor of art at New York University. One might call him the leading intellectual of contemporary art – our answer to Bernard Berenson. This year, however, he has surpassed even his own high-water mark. Named Dean of the Yale School of Art, in 2007 he will also become the first American ever to hold the post of Director of the Venice Biennale.",

Sam Keller, forty this year, has run the fair since 1994 – a 12-year stint that has seen it become easily the world’s biggest and most important international art event, spreading to the US in 2002. Keller will be leaving this behemoth to run the Fondation Beyeler: a small-ish modern art museum in his hometown, that is most famous for showing Bacons and Cézannes alongside primitive artworks. Keller denies that he is deserting Mammon for the god of public art, insisting that “Art Basel isn’t just Sam Keller, it’s a whole team” and that the Renzo Piano-designed Beyeler is “one of the world’s most beautiful museums of modern art”. Whether Art Basel’s sponsors will share his enthusiasm remains to be seen.",

He opened a second space in Berlin in 1992, but remained focused on Leipzig art. This was a canny decision, as interest in this school of art has since exploded: stable artists such as Neo Rauch (whose works were part of a big show this year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Tim Eitel (who recently showed at the gallery in Leipzig and previously at PaceWildenstein in New York) command solo shows as well as high prices.",

Famous for hosting lavish 700-guest dinner parties that kick-start Art Basel Miami Beach in December, the de la Cruz home, in Biscayne Bay, is a Mecca for artworld VIPs and ‘ordinary’ people alike – anyone can visit provided they have made an appointment. In 2004, the de la Cruzes launched the 10,000-square-foot Moore Space in Miami’s Design District, now a must-visit on the Art Basel Miami Beach public programme. Popular with artists and institutions (they recently donated work by John Bock, Philippe Parreno and Pierre Huyghe to Miami MoCA and Tate) the de la Cruzes have been vital to the promotion of Miami as a centre for contemporary art.\n\n",

After museum shows in Montreal and San Francisco, Kiefer hit his stride this year with a major solo show at White Cube Mason’s Yard. Aperiatur Terra furthered the sixty-two-yearold artist’s interest in the symbolic and the mythological, drawing on Biblical texts alluding to the coming of Christ to produce a massive installation of painting and sculpture. Kiefer scored a simultaneous hit with the architectural sculpture Jericho, two tottering towers of reinforced concrete that dominated the courtyard of the nearby Royal Academy of Arts; allegorical echoes of the Twin Towers merging with the blasted aesthetics of countless conflict zones. Aperiatur Terra has since toured to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney. Since then, the Guggenheim Bilbao has hosted a massive six-month retrospective of Kiefer’s work, during which time he has managed to fill the atrium of Paris’s Grand Palais with an installation of truly apocalyptic proportions. This autumn sees the opening of a special commission at the Louvre. Now the question could be; can Kiefer’s work get any bigger?",

Guggenheim Foundation) has spent much of the year talking up plans for the latest branch of the great art brand in Abu Dhabi. Due to be designed by Krens favourite Frank Gehry, the museum will cost between $200 and $400 million, and, alongside a branch of the Louvre, forms a key part of the Emirate’s attempt to recreate itself as a cultural Xanadu. Much of Krens’s influence is based on the success of the other Gehry-designed Guggenheim in Bilbao (since opening in 1997 it has drawn in nine million visitors, helped create 4,200 new jobs a year, and contributed $2 billion to Spain’s GDP). ‘Business moguls, governors, mayors – they all come through the Guggenheim on a regular basis. Bilbao has had such an enormous impact,’ said Krens in a recent interview, adding fuel to the fires of those critics (of which there are legion) who think that business is mostly what Krens is now about. But perhaps this is merely the most obvious symptom of the way art institutions are going. Krens also claims that over the last three years 130 cities have made requests for Guggenheimification.",

            "Whatever your opinion of Charles Saatchi, his approach to the artworld is never boring. While his relaunched Saatchi Gallery has been cranking out voluminous attention-grabbing shows from the collection, the former ad man has found time to author an art-school realityshow contest, knock out a second book of quitefunny answers to interview questions and once more ruffle the official art establishment’s feathers, this time with an offer to donate his collection to the nation. In July, Saatchi announced plans to turn his gallery into ‘MoCA London’, gifting £25m of work to the UK, but the Arts Council has reportedly baulked at the condition that the gallery be able to sell from the collection to fund acquisitions. As we await the next chapter, Saatchi is still, entertainingly, throwing his weight around.",

One was at the Museum der Bildenden Künste in his hometown of Leipzig – a city now as famous for the school of painting Rauch pioneered as it is for being the final resting place of J.S. Bach ­– the other at the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich. Commenting on the honour, news service Deutsche Welle barked, ‘He is one of the country’s most important living painters, and a de facto ambassador for modern German art’. On the commercial side, with Rauch’s work breaking its record price at auction (his 1999 painting Stellwerk sold for £892,450 in December), the artist is busy giving it away: donating 40 works on paper ­with a value of $130,000 to Aschersleben, the city of his grandparents. Rauch has promised to follow this initial bundle by giving away all subsequent work in the same medium to the city, with a view to a permanent exhibition opening there in spring 2012.",

He is also one of the world’s most active art collectors. And he was briefly a significant owner of Sotheby’s stock, during which time 20 works from his collection were shown by the auction house (whatever the agreement there, when the stock rose sharply a short time later, Cohen promptly dumped it). This year, among other purchases, Cohen acquired a 1958 Jasper Johns Flag painting for a reported $110m. Still, it’s a shame when you’re so busy you can’t enjoy your own collection. He recently mentioned retiring to ‘just watch a fucking movie, or hang with my kids’. OK, he forgot to mention ‘and stare at the fucking Flag’, but we’re pretty sure he meant that, too.",

Many hopes are pinned on such regional branches, and the distinctive building – notably near the German border, designed by Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines, with a roof resembling a fallen net – is meant to beckon tourists on looks alone. It duly attracted 100,000 visitors in the first four days it was open. As well as an ongoing scheme to use vacant space at the Palais de Tokyo to show work by midcareer artists, Pacquement has announced plans for a ‘pop-up’ mobile Pompidou centre that will further the brand’s expansion. Oh, yes, and bring more art to the people. When it comes to world domination, it seems funding (currently holding up Pompidou Mobile) is the only thing standing in Pacquement’s way. That and the strikes which recently closed several of France’s leading museums for several days.",

Once they’ve pulled on their wellies, however, it turns out that Wirth and his wife, Manuela Hauser, are ready to get down with both the mud and the cultural enrichment of his new ’hood. Hauser & Wirth Somerset – a converted seventeenth-century farmhouse and grounds, featuring multiple free-to-enter galleries, outdoor artworks and a buzzy restaurant – opened in July to general artworld approval, but perhaps more importantly, with a neighbourhood-pleasing programme of talks, workshops and site-relevant residencies. How this commitment to grassroots engagement will evolve to fit the decidedly more urban terrain of downtown LA when the 9,300sqm Hauser Wirth & Schimmel opens for business next year remains to be seen.",

This year the impact of the US company’s purchase of a 70 percent stake in Frieze became apparent, with a drive towards digital (and even talk of selling art through virtual reality); hence the arrival onto the list of Emanuel and Whitesell, CEO and executive chairman respectively. ‘The content opportunities are endless,’ an Endeavour representative enthused, ‘&#8230;especially as it relates to bringing the Frieze brand home to the consumer.’ In the fair aisles, overseen by Siddall, London is king: Frieze Masters commands respect critically, and the original contemporary fair pulls the kind of galleries that have not fully embraced the New York edition.&nbsp;</p>\n",

Works from the collection are now an almost constant presence in the Benaki Museum, Athens, for instance, where this year Joannou cocurated a survey of work by the late Greek sculptor George Lappas. In June, while artist Roberto Cuoghi and his team were kiln-firing dozens of ceramic crabs as part of the artist’s Deste commission on Hydra, The Equilibrists opened at the Benaki, featuring a survey of young Greek art selected from open submission and through a hundred studio visits by New Museum curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Massimiliano Gioni. The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer – False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober – all owned by Joannou. ",

            "It’s been quite a year for Tate director Nicholas Serota. In April he turned seventy and in June he celebrated the opening of Tate Modern’s new Herzog & de Meuron-designed Switch House building, to great attention and largely popular acclaim. Providing 60 percent more space and the opportunity to rehang the galleries, the addition put into practice Tate’s ongoing remit to show more women artists as well as more global artists. Of the 1,008 works acquired by Tate in 2015–16, 676 were by artists from outside the UK. Major exhibitions at Tate galleries by women artists during the same period included Marlene Dumas, Sonia Delaunay, Agnes Martin, Mona Hatoum and Barbara Hepworth. With new directors for Tate Modern (Frances Morris) and Tate Britain (Alex Farquharson) in place, and with his legacy secured, it was no great surprise that in September, after nearly 30 years at the head of the institution, Serota announced he would be step ping down. Another long-term relationship with Tate also came to a close when oil and gas company BP announced that it would be ending its 26-year sponsorship deal with the institution. BP cited the ‘challenging business environment’, but that didn’t take away the victory of activist collective Liberate Tate, who had been protesting the institution’s association with the company since 2010. Liberate Tate is now refocusing its campaign on other BP-sponsored art institutions. Serota isn’t ready for retirement either. In February 2017 he’ll be taking over from Peter Bazalgette in the (albeit Part-time) role of chair of Arts Council England.  ",

The gallery, one of the founding members of the Gallery Climate Coalition (a nonprofit launched in October with the aim of developing an industry-wide response to the climate crisis) has long been making sales ‘based purely on images’, Logsdail junior told Forbes, and as such the disruption wasn’t going to faze them: an online screening and exhibition programme launched in May. They did however open a galley in the Hamptons, where many monied New Yokers chose to sit out lockdown, and quickly set a sales record for Stanley Whitney, selling a painting for $850,000. Likewise, with the physical Frieze art fair in London cancelled, Lisson opened a new temporary space in Mayfair (leased until March). While London and New York City went in and out of lockdowns, the gallery’s one-year-old Shanghai premises staged shows for Shirazeh Houshiary and Julian Opie, with the latter launching multiple public art projects in the city.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "Just as you were the settling in to read last November’s Power 100 issue, Gorvy, the chairman and international head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s auction house, saw his New York saleroom hammer down Francis Bacon’s triptych Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) for $142.4m (£88.3m), the most expensive contemporary artwork ever sold at auction. That figure, along with the current vogue among collectors for paying high prices at auction for new works by very young artists, goes perhaps a little way towards accounting for the fact that sales of contemporary art now account for close to half of all auction business. For Gorvy, it’s booming, and with new collectors flooding in there’s no sign of a bust in sight. In a market like this one, and when your auction house is top of the food chain – Christie’s had record sales of just under £800m in the first six months of 2014, a rise of 20 percent over the same period in 2013 – you’re going to have to move jobs before you’ll be off this list.",

In September L&M Arts launched a new gallery at a former power plant in Venice, with local hero Paul McCarthy’s first gallery exhibition in his hometown in more than a decade. Speaking of the move, Lévy recently stated that she ‘felt that the old, postwar pole of Paris–New York had become Berlin–Los Angeles’. Like many of the galleries that have been able to expand through the recent economic chaos, Lévy and Mnuchin (a former equities trader and director of the New York Stock Exchange) split their operation between the secondary and primary markets, with the LA space their biggest statement yet of an intention to dominate the latter in the way they already dominate the former.",

Unfinished at the time of the artist’s death, in January, the recreation of Kelley’s childhood home – fixed up on wheels – is currently being completed and will be unveiled next year. Elsewhere there were projects by Lindsay Seers and Mark Storor, making it an average (meaning busy) 12 months for Artangel. Oh, and Lingwood and Morris got MBEs too.",

(Given this supportive emphasis, it’s unsurprising that Philbin describes the Hammer’s primary audience as artists.) Though region-based selections may have their problems, in a period in which there are fears about the homogenisation of the LA museums (due to the growing powers of Eli Broad and MOCA), the Hammer and LAXART will help to guarantee a strong home–city scene.",

            "While he may not have curated any biennials himself in the past year (albeit with São Paulo and Jakarta recently under his belt), Esche was a cocurator of the NSK State Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, making a sort of temporary floating embassy for the territory-less artist-state. Esche is also both an adviser to the Rijksakademie, Amsterdam, and a director of London publishing house Afterall. ‘It’s important that we constantly stretch the definition of what “making art public” means in terms of exhibitions,’ Esche told ArtReview last year, and the programme at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, which he has directed since 2004, reflects this: a new three-year exhibition titled The Way Beyond Art showcases some of the socially engaged and expanded practices that Esche champions, like Chto Delat and Can Altay. The Van Abbe also supports archival research and revision under its ‘Deviant Practice’ grants. Esche remains dedicated to exploring the limits of the contemporary museum. ",

Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes. \n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there’s Slotover’s influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city’s East End.",

            "Speaking to The Korea Times during the opening of Correspondence: Lee Ufan and Mark Rothko at Pace’s Seoul branch, CEO Glimcher was in a philosophical mood. ‘Artists are creating something that’s purely of the spirit, but we’re hoping someone will actually spend money on it. And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

Golden has ably stewarded the Studio Museum of Harlem for the past 15 years, renewing its curatorial and educational programming (Legacy Russell was appointed associate curator in 2018), creating one of the most sought-after residency programmes in the US and updating its physical plant with a $122m purpose-built, David Adjaye-designed building. This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration – something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Which means numerous exhibitions: at L&M Arts in New York, Gagosian in New York, Galería Hilario Galguera in New Mexico and Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum. This last retrospective not only found Hirst partying with Albert II, the principality’s crown prince; it also included spot, spin and butterfly paintings, all series which, he announced at the Gagosian show (entitled End of an Era), he would no longer be producing.\n\nThis may to some extent slow the shrinking of Hirst’s market – down by 93 percent last year and bound to be lower this annum – and allay the artist’s detractors, who in August reiterated and expanded on accusations of plagiarism. A charge Hirst branded ‘gibberish’. Still, Hirst isn’t one for cooling his heels. His Murderme art collection grows apace, his Other Criteria publishing wing and retail outlets continue to turn out books, sell multiples and support exhibitions – and he’s rumoured to have a longterm gig booked in: a Tate retrospective to coincide with London’s 2012 Olympics. ",

Broad (together with wife Edythe) wants to be the art angel in the City of Angels, creating press and fanfare whenever he gives. And give he undeniably does.\n\nThere are fears being voiced from LA’s art community that Broad is having a significant homogenising influence on the city’s museums. Press coverage of Broad is filled with sideswipes and barely concealed irritation on the part of patrons, curators and museum directors (except those he supports or those waiting for a cheque).\n\nThe truth is, however, that museums need Broad like never before: California has a 12 percent unemployment rate and a $20b deficit, and financial cuts are being made left, right and centre. Broad, with a fortune valued at $5.7b, has pledged to give 75 percent of it away. And the building of the Broad collection museum on Grand Avenue, designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which is now getting under way in earnest, should keep him busy for the time being.",

            "With Yayoi Kusama having joined Chris Ofili at David Zwirner, three of Victoria Miro’s established artists now also show with major international galleries that have a significant London presence, the third being Peter Doig at Michael Werner. However, Miro has come back with a major addition of her own this year, in the form of an elegant new gallery space in London’s Mayfair. And other gallery artists continue to maintain a high profile. \n\nElmgreen & Dragset’s exhibitions in 2013 have included a yearlong public project in Munich’s main squares and a major site-specific installation in the old textile galleries at the V&A in London. Meanwhile the ever-popular and populist Grayson Perry becomes the first visual artist to deliver the BBC’s annual Reith Lectures. The recent addition of Kara Walker to the gallery’s roster won’t do any harm either. ",

            "The former assistant to Joseph Beuys’s assistant, a job he got by knocking on the great artist’s studio door, has since notched up 40 years as a gallerist. He celebrated – how else? – with a show of Beuys’s works on paper at his London gallery at the start of the year, and another at Ropac’s Seoul branch at the end of the year. Having opened in Salzburg in 1983, and adding two London and two Paris spaces along the way, Ropac landed in South Korea in 2021 and this year doubled the square meterage there by adding another floor, allowing for a simultaneous exhibition of Donald Judd’s sculptures and paintings in September. As well as some of the great American estates, Ropac has become the de facto rep for canonical artists of the German-speaking world, among them VALIE EXPORT, Anselm Kiefer, Not Vital and Imi Knoebel. Georg Baselitz turned eighty-five this year, so there were more celebrations to arrange, with shows staged by the painter at nine institutions around the world, including at London’s Serpentine galleries and Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich.",

For his Autumn/ Winter collection for Saint Laurent, Hedi Slimane issued an invitation and showbook featuring artwork supplied by Baldessari and centred the collection around three heavily-sequined dresses inspired by the artist’s 50-year career. Sticking to things French: the artist also unveiled a 30m-long light installation in Paris titled Your Name in Lights (2011), in which members of the public’s names are… well, you get the picture. Yet it was back home that Baldessari showed what an artworld powerhouse he is – beyond, even, the fact of his canonical art – when he, alongside peers Barbara Kruger and Catherine Opie, gave MoCA’s new director, Philippe Vergne, a vote of confidence by returning to the beleaguered museum’s board in March this year, after having left it in June 2012 in protest at the direction Jeffrey Deitch was taking the institution.  ",

However, as the head of Kaikai Kiki (the artist’s art production company), Murakami has successfully introduced his artists into the artworld. Murakami’s personal career is still flourishing: two solo gallery shows (in Hong Kong and LA) and one institutional show, Takashi in Superflat Wonderland, at Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul. His debut feature film, Jellyfish Eyes (2013), had its international premiere in April. And the Japanese makeup brand Shu Uemura has announced a cosmetics collection, titled Six Hearts Princes, based on Murakami’s 6HP anime project.",

The cool middle-aged people were represented there, too: an exhibition of Michael Krebber’s austere works in May ‘still managed to piss people off’, reported Artforum. But it was a dead cool person who really stole the limelight in 2019. In the early 1950s, Andy Warhol collaborated with author Ralph Thomas (‘Corkie’) Ward on a series of self-published books. The first of these, A Is an Alphabet, a collection of 26 loose pages that feature Warhol’s cute illustrations and Ward’s weird rhymes – ‘a surreal, horny fairytale’, as Interview succinctly described it – went on show in Berlin before travelling to New York.",

(Koons donated the concept, not the finished work; one critic called it a ‘poisoned chalice’.) Despite this, Koons remains undeterred, focusing on a series of bags being created with Louis Vuitton: a Mona Lisa backpack or a Rubens duffel, anyone? When it comes to an unruffled engagement with capitalism and the smoothest of productions, Koons remains king. ",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‘Artists… like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.’ His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who’s who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks’s skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive. ",

As chairman and CEO of luxury group LVMH, a little bit of his Bloomberg-estimated $97.3bn fortune goes to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. This year the private museum gave over its galleries to Gilbert & George, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Courtauld’s hallowed collection of Impressionism. The foundation’s smaller ‘espaces’ in Venice and Tokyo, meanwhile, hosted shows by Philippe Parreno and Christian Boltanski respectively. Yet it was an even more spectacular brand of philanthropy that put Arnault and his family in the spotlight this year, after they publicly announced a €200m donation to Notre-Dame while the cathedral was still smouldering (conveniently overshadowing the €100m earlier pledged by his nemesis François Pinault). Sceptics suggested that Arnault would benefit from a tax break (he says not), and sniping over this and other megadonations was only partially quelled when, in September, they were eventually signed off.",

            "Despite attempts by artists, thinkers and social movements to propose different ways of working, the market model remains resilient. But Gladstone’s artists are often witty commentators on such tensions. Serve the Dominant Ideology or Stop Being a Pussy, Frances Stark’s first exhibition with the gallery since her old home, Gavin Brown’s enterprise, folded into Gladstone in 2020, opened in June and featured 12 paintings of open books. Another astute commentator on the artworld, artist David Salle, and the lucrative estate of Robert Rauschenberg also joined the gallery’s roster this year. With locations in New York, Brussels and Seoul [https://artreview.com/gladstone-gallery-to-open-new-seoul-space/], and artists ranging from Matthew Barney [https://artreview.com/matthew-barney-secondary-no-pain-no-gain/] to Marisa Merz and Rachel Rose (all of whom had shows), as well as the likes of Rirkrit Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] and Sarah Lucas (who have had significant shows elsewhere this year), Gladstone has colossal spread. But sometimes trouble presents itself closer to home: a lawsuit by a former New York employee made its way through the courts.",

Then again, the collector (and MoMA board member) whose donations to the museum between 1997 and 2016 form this sweeping survey of Latin American art, Sur moderno: Journeys of Abstraction – The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift, is hardly your ordinary buyer. Her holdings, concentrating on art from Latin America, are constantly on loan, as well as increasingly being gifted directly to institutions. For example, the Reina Sofía in Madrid was given 45 works by 33 artists (all made since 1990) in March from the Phelps de Cisneros collection, a bequest that followed another donation of 202 works in January to Reína Sofia, MoMA and five other international museums. Hers is a name worth remembering for independent curators and scholars, too: Phelps de Cisneros is the purse behind various residencies and research fellowships, including the Independent Curators International’s annual travel grant.",

Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

            "Tricky year for Weinberg. At the end of 2018, the forthcoming Whitney Biennial – at the museum he’s directed since 2003 – became a flashpoint for controversy when employees demanded the removal of board member Warren B. Kanders over his involvement with teargas manufacturer Safariland. This after the 2017 biennial had been embroiled in a war of words over its inclusion of a painting accused of sensationalising racist violence. This time around, Weinberg dithered, artists quit the biennial and Kanders eventually resigned. One sensed damage-control when, in September, the institution broke ground on David Hammons’s monumental public project Day’s End and Weinberg described the installation as representing ‘our commitment to community and civic good’. Meanwhile, the Whitney continued to settle into its downtown home, with a big Warhol retrospective and an emphasis on shows for artists of colour (Pope.L, Kevin Beasley, Derek Fordjour). How much reputational damage the biennial hullabaloo has caused in the long term remains to be seen.",

            "As any Richter historian will tell you: trying to pinpoint a sense of style to the artist’s work is a task doomed to failure. For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter’s subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‘signature’ aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‘cult of personality’ he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‘It’s a frightening development,’ he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales – Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m – it’s been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman’s New York space in May). But his influence on painting globally remains big.  ",

She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

            "‘An institution is a learning system’, Obrist told Forbes this year while discussing the ‘Year of AI’ at London’s Serpentine Galleries. Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

            "For the past few years the press has been speculating on seventy-nine-year-old Larry Gagosian’s succession plans for what is regularly estimated as a business with a $1 billion annual turnover (accumulated through the sale of works by the likes of Nan Goldin [https://artreview.com/artist/nan-goldin/], Carol Bove and Richard Prince [https://artreview.com/richard-prince-clearview-ai-and-your-face-gagosian/], who each had a show this year in at least one of Gagosian’s 19 galleries around the world). There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
