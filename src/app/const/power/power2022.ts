            "‘Frieze is just like an extremely important week for the city.’ So drooled one socialite to Vanity Fair ahead of Frieze Los Angeles. Frieze, under CEO Fox, is adept at making an art fair feel like an event, and this year added to its US footprint not only by moving the West Coast edition to Santa Monica Airport but by hosting the recently acquired Expo Chicago and the Armory Show in New York. ‘The economics of art fairs are challenging,’ Fox told the same reporter in March. Referring to Emanuel’s Endeavor, Frieze’s parent company, he added, ‘We are taken very seriously by Ari and the team’. A month is a long time in business. A few weeks later plans were put in place to take Endeavor private in 2025 (after equity fund Silver Lake bought the $13b of stock it didn’t already own), and the group is now considering selling the art fair in a pessimistic market: just ‘moderate sales’ were reported at the third edition of Frieze Seoul, though the London original was deemed more successful, helped by the sale of a number of works to several UK institutional collections (aided by Endeavor-funded partnerships with the fair) including the Contemporary Art Society, Tate and the Arts Council.",

            "Thanks to social media, we all aspire to speak in shareable aphorisms now, but Kruger was doing it decades ago, and her truth-to-power reflections on consumerism, sexism and structural violence speak to our moment as cogently and urgently as they did in the 80s. In the lead to and after the US’s historic decision to overrule Roe v Wade, Kruger’s iconic 1989 posters for abortion rights reappeared all over the country, charged with renewed urgency. Her signature wraparound, printed-vinyl, black-and-white slogans – embellished with deadpan smiling and frowning emoticons – were seemingly everywhere in 2022: they touched down loudly in Venice’s Arsenale, in a largescale commission for New York’s MoMA and all over the floor of Berlin’s newly reopened Neue Nationalgalerie. And Kruger’s aesthetic is everywhere, her vintage classic white-text-on-red-plus-found-monochrome-image template being by now a popular meme format as well as a T-shirt and poster fixture. Few contemporary artists have such cultural reach, so it’s a good thing the messages accompanying Kruger’s networked artworks are ethically unimpeachable.",

            "Julien’s 2022 five-screen film installation Once Again… (Statues Never Die) explores the relationship between Albert C. Barnes, an early collector of African art, and Alain Locke, the Harlem Renaissance instigator and proponent of restitution, with all the sensuality that has become characteristic of the British artist’s work. The film was exhibited this year at the Whitney Biennial [https://artreview.com/whitney-biennial-2024-new-york-review/], New York, and MCA Australia, Sydney, where The Sydney Morning Herald, ‘in an age where so-called political and postcolonial art tends toward sermonising’, found the film ‘unexpectedly healing’. Julien’s work meditates on the sins of the past, finding balm in the intersection of race and sexuality, not least in Lessons of the Hour (2019), his cinematic portrait of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, which was shown for eight months in New York, first at Skidmore College’s Tang Museum and then at MoMA (Julien’s iconic Looking for Langston, 1989, is also currently on show there as part of the permanent collection). Meanwhile, Julien became Fellow of the British Academy this year, and his survey exhibition, What freedom is to me, travelled to Bonnefanten, Maastrich.",

Things now look somewhat rosier, after the successful launch this autumn of Paris+ by Art Basel. The aggressive takeover of longtime French fair FIAC’s traditional Grand Palais venue and date led to the chief of Art Cologne hitting out at Art Basel’s ‘colonialism’. As Spiegler steps down from the company in December, and Noah Horowitz returns from a brief role at Sotheby’s to take on the position of CEO, the expansion and search for profit continues. At the start of the year, MCH reacquired a stake in Singapore’s Art SG fair, though Art Basel Hong Kong, with a volatile political situation and many lockdown measures still in place, saw just under half the 2019 number of galleries take part. Exhibitors at Art Basel in Basel returned to pre-pandemic levels, and the fair is hosting its largest-ever Miami edition, with rumoured plans for a year-round selling platform to come.",

Part of the Blk Art Group of artists who resisted the reactionary government of Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s, Boyce has long carved her own path, not least educating generations of students across British art schools. Earlier this year Boyce presented Radio Ballads, a project for the Serpentine Galleries and Barking Town Hall, the fruit of half-a-decade’s work within a community setting; she also opened her inaugural solo show with Simon Lee Gallery and a public commission for Cork Street, both in London. Boyce is the subject of an episode of the BBC documentary series Imagine that was broadcast in November, following the artist as she prepared for the Venice Biennale. All this while continuing to teach as professor and chair in Black Art and Design at the University of Arts London.",

            "‘The museum I want is dissident… but it will not only be a place of rage and rebellion, it will also be a place of awareness and care,’ the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona told elDiario.es. Following this ethos, Ose is looking to open the museum’s architecture up to the street, building on a preexisting expansion project due by 2024, and making its education programme more prominent to passersby. This commitment to the immediate surroundings also manifested in a series of events dedicated to the ‘aesthetics… around Barcelona’. None of which is to say that Ose isn’t also internationally focused, with the museum’s big 2022 draw being a Carrie Mae Weems exhibition she curated, as well as a trip to Mexico to organise Oaxaca’s Hacer Noche art festival (she is also part of the group that originally selected ruangrupa to helm Documenta, whom she defended amidst all the controversies).",

            "‘My first audience would be a Kenyan audience… I wanted them to see something… that would have relevance to them and their lives,’ said Armitage this year. Yet his figurative paintings – often ambiguous scenes, ‘points of contention… that I don’t have a clear moral attitude on’, created not on canvas (to avoid the Western-centric history of the material) but lubugo, a Ugandan textile used in funerary rites made from fig tree bark – have found an audience internationally as much as at home. While Armitage has put much of his energy into his Nairobi Contemporary Art Institute, a nonprofit for East African art he set up in 2020, this year he won the UK Government Art Collection’s Robson Orr TenTen Award and had a solo exhibition at Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria. NCAI meanwhile has provided a platform to showcase Kenyan artists, including a retrospective of Kenyan artist Chelenge Van Rampelberg and an exhibition of Syowia Kyambi’s recent work across media.",

A very small selection of these were installed at Documenta in Kassel over the summer: footage relating to the postcolonial Faculty of Fine Arts in Vadodara, India, and to Womanifesto, a Thai feminist collective; and ephemera from performance-art festivals that emerged in East and Southeast Asia. Yet the real work of the archive is often more modest in scale, whether talks from AAA grantees on Punjab-era communist publications, the opening of Guangdong pioneer Huang Xiaopeng’s archives or a mobile library travelling from town to town in Nepal. The archive has fans too: this year it received $25,000 from the Hauser & Wirth Institute to process and digitise the papers of multifaceted Pakistani modernist Zahoor ul Akhlaq.",

Though no stranger to one of Europe’s biggest art centres (notably curating a survey for Neïl Beloufa in 2018), the art critic and curator hasn’t really been on the traditional museum-director circuit. Instead Désanges, who has for the past decade served as curator of La Verrière-Hermès in Brussels and the Méthode Room, an artist residency in Chicago, has acquired a reputation for using institutions as laboratories for experiments that place the visitors at its centre – which might be exactly what Palais de Tokyo needs to restore some of its original edginess. For its 20th anniversary, Désanges celebrated with a series of events including a festival curated by Marinella Senatore, a symposium gathering other Paris institutions to talk ecological transition and a therapy session of sorts to probe the Palais’s history and via an art and wellbeing programme. Through his curatorial agency, Work Method, he now also directs the long-running Salon de Montrouge, which showcases emerging artists every October.",

In that exhibition she showed Double Plot (2018), a vast tapestry depicting the solar system, while more recent textiles, drawings, photographs, sculptures and performance works featured in solo shows at the Frist Art Museum, Nashville, and the Institut Valencià d’Art Modern. ‘Care’ is not just a modish curatorial buzzword for Nkanga, but the driving force behind O8 Black Stone, a black soap made of petrol sediment (name-checked in Teju Cole’s new book), sold in aid of her Athens project space, Akwa Ibom, and an organic farm in Nigeria that promotes biodiverse planting practices and doubles as a hub for the rural community. While shifting galleries, from Mendes Wood DM to Lisson, Nkanga remains as formally innovative as she is socially conscious, winning this year’s $100,000 Nasher Prize [https://artreview.com/otobong-nkanga-wins-the-2025-nasher-prize/] for Sculpture.",

For Singh’s work is in constant flux: the artist seeks out new arrangements from her vast archive of images and exhibits them as ‘minimuseums’ of concertinaed books and portable display walls; her unusual formatting encourages viewers to play a role in the sequencing of her photographs, allowing a democratic sensibility to permeate her work. At both the Gwangju and São Paulo [https://artreview.com/35th-bienal-de-sao-paulo-review-choreographies-of-the-impossible/] biennials this year, she presented these alongside a regular foray into moving image with Mona and Myself (2013), a video portrait of Mona, a third-gender eunuch whom Singh met during the 1980s, and who became a close friend and muse to the artist. Long before questions of gender identity were a mainstay in the artworld, Singh was investigating this, and other subjects pushed to the margins of society, with a keen eye and great empathy.",

The biennale, originally set to open in December 2024, was postponed by a year following a period of concern that it might be cancelled completely. This was due to a debt owed to the event’s waterfront venue since its first edition in 2012. These issues have now been resolved, with new private patrons coming to the rescue and a new chair (former director general of the National Museum in Delhi, Venu Vasudevan). This year the biennial, in partnership with Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation, presented the inaugural New Dialogues: Contemporary Art From South Asia conference at London’s Southbank Centre. Meanwhile, Krishnamachari, who also makes art, can now put ‘gallerist’ on his CV: in October he opened a contemporary space inside the new Bangalore store of interior design studio Dtale, showing works by Astha Butail, Harisha Chennangod, Pooja Iranna and Prajakta Potnis.",

Yet her gallery, Take Ninagawa, thrived and now represents the likes of Shinro Ohtake and Aki Sasamoto [https://artreview.com/aki-sasamoto-point-reflection-queens-museum-new-york-sounding-lines-para-site-hong-kong/] from Japan, and Wang Bing [https://artreview.com/wang-bing-filmmaking-is-not-that-complicated/], Danh Vo and Ken Okiishi from abroad. In October she opened an exhibition of work by Ryoko Aoki, ready for Art Week Tokyo, the fourth edition of the annual citywide festival pioneered by Ninagawa herself. Now staged in collaboration with Art Basel (Ninagawa sits on the fair’s selection committee for its Basel edition), the event draws an international crowd and is eager to establish a new hub in Asia to rival Seoul and away from the censorship present in Hong Kong and mainland China. Over 50 galleries and museums across the city took part in the event, which included a selling show at Okura Museum of Art curated by Mami Kataoka, and AWT Video, a series of moving image works programmed by Sohrab Mohebbi that screened at SMBC East Tower.",

In May they collaborated again for Calel’s solo [https://artreview.com/edgar-calel-balabaj-jaguar-stone-sculpture-center-new-york-review/] at New York’s SculptureCenter (which Mohebbi directs). Challenging Western artistic hegemonies, Calel’s work often sits somewhere between artwork and ritual, foregrounding an Indigenous cosmological worldview. He made news in 2021 by allowing Tate to be custodians of Ru k’ox k’ob’el jun ojer etemab’el (The Echo of an Ancient Form of Knowledge, 2021), a work that involved the invocation of his ancestors – which also appeared in this year’s Liverpool Biennial [https://artreview.com/liverpool-biennial-2023-review-tending-to-the-wound/]. At the Gwangju Biennale, Calel showed a new iteration of the work, and at the Bienal de São Paulo [https://artreview.com/35th-bienal-de-sao-paulo-review-choreographies-of-the-impossible/] the artist presented an installation of embroideries representing the collective architecture and rituals of the Brazilian Guarani community.",

Fostering critical discussions within the art scene in Ghana, while building international connections, this amorphous collective acts as an exhibition platform and support network, modelling a form of headless institution. Beyond its Kumasi project space are exchange programmes with art schools in Germany, and residency swaps in Denmark and Uganda. Historical survey Ghana 1957: Art After Independence was cocurated by Kwasi Ohene-Ayeh in Accra, while the group collaborated with Berlin’s SAVVY Contemporary in shaping part of its Transitions project. Members often swap seamlessly between the roles of artist and curator, such as Tracy Naa Koshie Thompson, who cocurated a two-part exhibition at Gallery 1957’s London and Accra spaces, then took part in the Busan Biennale [https://artreview.com/busan-biennale-2024-seeing-in-the-dark-review-mark-rappolt/], and Bernard Akoi-Jackson, who organised Elolo Bosoka’s show at Accra’s Museum of Science and Technology, and whose work is currently on display in the photography biennial Bamako Encounters.",

            "‘Don’t buy NFTs as a financial investment… Buy them because you love the art and you want to support the artists,’ tweeted the artist, digital art enthusiast and NFT proselytiser in March. An early convert to the possibilities of blockchain technology for changing the way digital artists sell their work and preserve it for posterity, Bailey has made it his business throughout the hype of the crypto-NFT boom to keep the focus on the art, not the money. As the artworld went NFT-crazy in 2021, Bailey (who tweets and blogs as artnome) set up Club NFT, to develop solutions to the problems of secure NFT ownership. And to counter what he saw as the traditional artworld’s tendency to ‘treat NFT artists and NFT collectors as if they’re not really artists and collectors’, Bailey launched the online magazine Right Click Save in January, publishing intelligent critical writing on artistic developments in the rapidly evolving blockchain space.",

Bullen’s work provides a leading example of how art institutions might create, as she has put it, ‘sustainable pathways’ for Indigenous artists. This spring Bullen organised an expansive set of six exhibitions under the title of BlakLight, giving over AGWA’s entire programme and building to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists – remarkably the first time this has happened in an Australian public gallery. It might be seen as a visible culmination of Bullen’s long-term work supporting both Indigenous artists and art critics, ‘to ensure authentic representation and interpretation of ourselves across all forms of our cultural material’.",

News of unionisation at US institutions has become a daily occurrence, and the Culture Group chapter of the Public and Commercial Services Union in the UK has seen an influx in members (who will be part of a cross-industry nationwide strike at the end of the year).

Unshackled, Ahmed has become one of the most important voices in feminist and queer-activist discourse, especially when it involves exposing hypocrisy within supposedly liberal, progressive institutions. This year, publication of The Feminist Killjoy Handbook offered a practical guide to rocking the boat, which includes ‘being willing to confront institutional problems… and to challenge how [institutions] use our efforts to change them as evidence they have changed’. She has been supporting the book with a lecture tour of university campuses in the US and elsewhere. Her messages, such as ‘I like to call diversity practitioners institutional plumbers’ – offering temporary fixes that are in turn claimed and trumpeted loudly by management – have resonated in the staffrooms of museums and galleries internationally.",

It would be useful for the artist if she could replicate herself IRL, given her exhausting schedule this year. Winning the Future Fields Commission, she presented a new work at Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin, which then moved to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. That was after having closed two museum solo shows at Bergen Kunsthall, in January, and Fridericianum, Kassel, in February, and before opening another two at MCA Chicago and Hessel Museum of Art at Bard, New York. The latter is timed with her first foray into feature film (to be streamed on Mubi), The African Desperate, a satire of the artworld, and of art education, set at Bard and starring Bridget Donahue, Syms’s New York gallerist, and artist A. L. Steiner, her former teacher, as her fictional professors.\n\n",

This holistic approach is necessary when dealing with themes such as the slave trade, the figure of the Amazon and the Vodun religion, as the curator did for the first Benin Pavilion [https://artreview.com/venice-biennale-2024-a-guide-to-the-arsenale/#:~:text=and%20heritage%2C%20the-,Republic%20of%20Benin,-makes%20its%20debut] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] (featuring the work of Chloé Quenum, Moufouli Bello, Ishola Akpo and Romuald Hazoumè). The founder and director of African Artists’ Foundation, the 16-year-old nonprofit arts organisation, and Lagos Photo Festival has been preoccupied with questions of survival: in 2020 the foundation was evicted from its base by its landlords, unfairly it claims, which has put its activities on hiatus. Meanwhile, a new iteration of Dig Where You Stand – From Coast to Coast, a roaming and evolving exhibition project about decolonisation, restitution and repatriation, which Nwagbogu initiated in 2022, landed this year in Benin.",

This included artefacts of American pop culture, Arabic literature, punk cinema, childhood drawings and photographs relating to the artist’s childhood, spent between Washington State and the Middle East. The show also featured her trilogy Beast Type Song (2019), which was the subject of a solo at Turku Art Museum in Finland; Tender Point Ruin (2021); and Tiger Strike Red (2022), lo-fi sci-fi works that present possible futures haunted by imperialist pasts, dystopias threaded through with the hope of what she has called ‘counter-histories’. As the Emirates increases its footprint in the arts, Al-Maria has emerged as one of the region’s most prescient voices. Her interest in future ruins was evident too in the video she made for Miu Miu and the Italian fashion house’s Spring/Summer 2024 runway show.",

When in 2018 the authorities in Havana announced a new law designed to silence artists, Decree 349, Alcántara became the figurehead of the San Isidro Movement, named after a neighbourhood of the city. For this he has been repeatedly persecuted, and having been on hunger strike [https://artreview.com/cuban-artist-luis-manuel-otero-alcantara-forced-into-hospital-after-hunger-strike/] in prison without trial, this year he was sentenced to five years [https://artreview.com/cuban-artist-jailed-for-five-years-over-decree-349/] for the crime of ‘insulting national symbols’. The prosecution cited a series of Alcántara’s artworks featuring the county’s flag. While Alcántara is one of more than 700 people currently imprisoned over the four-year-old protest, Lavastida, a member of the 27N collective, is one of the many more now living outside the country, winning an Index on Censorship Freedom of Expression Award.",

Increasingly present in the gallery as much as the cinema, Apichatpong saw over seven hours of his short films exhibited across Kiang Malingue’s two Hong Kong premises at the start of the year (the dealer went on to take them to various art fairs, including a screening at Art Basel Hong Kong). Yet Apichatpong is perhaps most comfortable on set, among the lush landscapes he had made his own, and in August he returned to the forest, specifically the jungles of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, to lead a ten day Herzogesque workshop for emerging filmmakers; next year he will be in Sri Lanka, making a film inspired by Arthur C. Clarke, cowriter of the screenplay for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and longtime resident of the country.",

            "Painting is everywhere, you may have noticed, and abstraction is beginning to supplant figuration again. But few of its contemporary practitioners come close to Sillman’s jolie-laide visual nous, perhaps because her work springs from unusual, twined roots: the unfettered vibrancy of Abstract Expressionism and the pop mobility of animation (which, along with zines, she also makes and exhibits on iPads). That she’s contributed to revivifying her medium was reflected in Sillman’s presence in Cecilia Alemani’s international exhibition at this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/59th-venice-biennale-review-revelation-and-illusion/], where the American painter’s big paintings on dangling paper moved like a filmstrip, her restless compositions semaphoring suggestions of human and animal bodies. Meanwhile, for latecomers, images from that show fold into a soon-to-come reissue of her terrific 2020 book of selected writings, Faux Pas. It’s been a long ride since her career’s mid-1970s outset, but Sillman is finally being recognised as a multi-talented modern master.",

            "With striking Hollywood actors and AI-generated artworks winning art competitions, the question of whether machines are going to take over artmaking is a hot topic. Musician Herndon and artist partner Dryhust have been ahead of that particular question for years; Herndon’s clear-sighted experiments into AI songmaking resulted in Holly+, her ‘digital twin’, who can reshape existing songs in Herndon’s own voice. (Herndon is also on the 2024 jury for the Paris-based IRCAM’s prestigious Generative Music Prize.) As the implications of AI learning from art made by humans become clearer, the pair have been vocal advocates [https://artreview.com/ai-art-and-the-problem-of-consent/] of artists’ rights; in March their online tool – allowing artists to check if their work has been used to train AI models, and opt out – attracted 40,000 signatories, with several AI companies agreeing to respect artists’ wishes, including Stability AI. It’s no wonder that Herndon made Time magazine’s ‘100 AI’ list in September. As Dryhurst told Freethink magazine, ‘I don’t see any conflict between being very, very excited about… machine learning, and also being very loyal to or concerned about artist welfare’.",

            "“Why do we feel so disconnected when our inventions are meant to connect each and every one of us?” asked the artist during her TED talk this year. If Yi has a mission – citing Donna Haraway and Anna Tsing – it’s to recognise the interconnectedness of humans, nonhuman life and machines. At her talk, the artist was joined by a single ‘aerobe’, from the fleet of autonomous floating robots she premiered at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall last year. More interspecific friends were present at her retrospective at Pirelli Hangar Bicocca in Milan, this time microscopic soil bacteria and algae growing in Biologizing the Machine (spillover zoonotica) (2022). It’s telling that, such is our alienation from the nature surrounding us, Yi’s paintings at her shows at Gladstone’s New York and Seoul spaces appear as digital abstractions, not the depictions of ‘blood cells and fish eggs, scratched and ruptured skin, polyps and crustaceans’ they actually are. Yi was also invited to take part in a yearlong residency at Stanford University, where she will engage students and faculty with her research.\n\n",

Their latest work, Night Fishing with Ancestors (2023), shown this year at solo exhibitions at Secession in Vienna, the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and Goldsmiths CCA in London, as well as various screenings internationally, is typical, loosely centring on the story of eighteenth-century Macassan traders who sailed to the Australian coast from Indonesia to collect sea cucumbers, a moment of collaborative trade before the extractivist violence of white colonialism. As much as the content of their productions has won praise, woozily mixing documentary, sci-fi and humour, so has their decentred way of working, in which profits from screenings and prizes are ploughed into the development of their own community and their ongoing attempts to reclaim land from the Australian state.",

Along the way she has brought attention to many of the new stars of the Black figurative painting renaissance, not least Ghanaians Amoako Boafo and Zohra Opoku, and Nigerian Peter Uka (who showed at the Paris gallery in October). The CDMX gallery opened with an exhibition of Hawaiian-born, locally based Clotilde Jiménez’s largescale cubist-inflected collages, paintings and ceramics.

            "Having risen to the pinnacle of artworld visibility over the last half- decade by choreographing highly Instagrammable performance pieces that engaged with the mainstreaming and exhaustion of subcultural spaces, Imhof executed a pronounced heel-turn this year, editing out her disaffected live performers and leaning into sculptural installation and ambient menace. The steely labyrinth of Youth at Amsterdam’s Stedeljik Museum was augmented with wintry, Moscow-shot footage of Imhof’s muse Eliza Douglas; meanwhile, the German artist’s darkly poetic shows at Buchholz in New York and Sprüth Magers in London felt like evacuated stages, foregrounding metal lockers (mostly closed) and multipanel paintings of billowing smoke. Imhof doesn’t seem wholly done with live events, but she told Monopol this year that her performances need, she thinks, to move outside of institutions altogether. And her work increasingly resonates in the worlds of fashion and pop culture. The artworld feted Imhof again this year – she won the €50,000 Binding Culture Prize – but it increasingly looks too small for her ambitions.",

            "On closing her four-venue European travelling show at Tate Britain in February, Yiadom-Boakye was confirmed as one of Britain’s foremost painters, leaving critics enamoured with her oil paintings of timeless figures – all Black, some posed, some acting out everyday playful scenes. ‘A living old master’, The Guardian reckoned. ‘Her touch is sublime. She animates a face with a few marks and patches of bare canvas,’ commented the Evening Standard. ‘[A] very, very good painter. Thick and rough with the brush but just precise enough,’ thought Time Out. Ever prolific, she went on in March to fill the Guggenheim Bilbao with a selection of over 70 paintings and charcoal drawings, all shown for the first time and made in the last three years. Being one of the leading practitioners of Black figuration comes with commercial success too: her 2015 painting Six Birds in the Bush, a portrait of a young Black man sporting a purple feather in his hat and who appears as though caught in a daydream, sold for £2.95m at Sotheby’s in October.",

The book, which has evolved from the Feral Atlas online project, considers (as has come to be expected from the UC Santa Cruz professor), the unexpected outcomes and responsibilities of humanity’s methods of populating and extracting from the planet – as told through the nonhuman presence of, for example, beetles, water hyacinths and dry rot fungus. While this year saw publication of a new edition of her 2004 book Friction, using forest fires in Indonesia to reflect on globalisation, her more recent articles and talks have focused on concrete and how its use in the built environment precipitates floods. As climates continue to shift, artists continue to look to Tsing to help map the new terrain.",

The artist’s comment relates to his interest in taking money out of the West, through the sale of such sculptures, and funnelling it back into Tamale, the region of northern Ghana where the artist was raised and still lives. There he has built three institutions [https://artreview.com/ibrahim-mahama-builds-museums-of-the-future/], Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art, Red Clay Studio and Nkrumah Volini, each with its own programme of exhibitions and education initiatives. This reparative practice has won him fans: institutional shows this year include Fruitmarket, Edinburgh; Barbican Centre, London; and Mönchehaus Museum Goslar; while newly commissioned works were presented at the Lagos Biennial and Desert X AlUla, Saudi Arabia.",

In 15 years the Rajas have not only built and established two galleries in the city and a third in Mumbai, but also an entire ecosystem, created through the Experimenter Curators’ Hub, which held its 14th edition this year; their online learning-orientated Experimenter Labs; Experimenter Books; an outpost exhibition programme that ‘inhabits disused, characterful spaces’; and the Generator Co-operative Art Production Fund, which offers small bursaries for art production. TRI opened with solo shows by Experimenter artists Prabhakar Pachpute and Kallol Datta, while at the same time during Mumbai Gallery Weekend the Rajas staged exhibitions by Afrah Shafiq and Alexandra Bachzetsis, and camp’s monumental 2022 seven-channel installation Bombay Tilts Down could be seen in the open air down at the city’s docks. This autumn, Sohrab Hura opened his first US survey show at New York’s MoMA PS1.",

            "Upending the classics seems to be the theme this year for the multidisciplinary artist, who embraces a state of in-betweenness both in terms of personal identity and in the mediums of her projects, which variously include filmmaking, performance and installation. Over the past five years she has been scandalising conservative critics and audiences at the stately Swiss theatre Schauspielhaus Zürich in her role as a guest director by staging avant-garde updates to canonical works including Orpheus (2021), Pinocchio (2022) and The Tempest (2024), while increasing gender and racial diversity in the productions. (The magnificent Moby-Dick; or, The Whale [https://artreview.com/wu-tsang-of-whales-thyssen-bornemisza-museo-nacional-madrid-moby-dick-review/], 2022, a silent film retelling Herman Melville’s novel, premiered there, and has since travelled the world to acclaim.) Together with her longtime collaborators, the open collective Moved by the Motion, Wu closed her stint at the Schauspielhaus with a hybrid operatic-theatrical take on Georges Bizet’s 1875 Carmen. The show received mixed reviews – but judging by the upcoming touring schedule of Wu’s projects, she’ll be keeping busy.",

In March Essers supported a show of Lindokuhle Sobekwa’s photographs at the Johannesburg Art Gallery; while the Cape Town space held exhibitions for multimedia artists Mikhael Subotzky and Alfredo Jaar. The London gallery opened a survey of the late painter Atta Kwami, which moved to the New York space, complementing its inaugural full year of programming, featuring Misheck Masamvu, Zineb Sedira and Kapwani Kiwanga, among others. Meanwhile, visitors to the Cheetah Plains luxury safari lodge on the Sabi Sand Nature Reserve may have gone for the lions and leopards, but could stay for the art: in January it opened a private art gallery in partnership with Goodman Gallery, to the delight of its the wildlife-hungry holidaymakers.",

He’s also a stylist whose steady stream of digestibly short, aphorism-filled books pair well with social media-tinged attention spans. Titling his 2023 book Via Contemplativa: In Praise of Inactivity might seem a little at odds, coming from such a prolific writer, though it’s a paean to the unhurried contemplation of reality, rather than commendation for doing nothing at all. And if said reality gives you the shivers, this year the Korean-German thinker published the Anselm Kiefer-illustrated The Spirit of Hope – ‘a plea against the crisis of fear’ by the same writer who also in 2024 put out The Crisis of Narration, which lamented the loss of richly complex storytelling and the social media-fuelled shift towards ‘storyselling’. Problems everywhere, then, but it’s all grist to Han’s fast-moving diagnostic mill.",

Hopkins was speaking as executive director and chief curator at Forge Project, New York, which this year transitioned from a private foundation to a nonprofit, with an Indigenous steering council including artists Sky Hopinka and Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/]. While Forge holds its own collection, its programme is one led not by exhibitions but residencies, community days, discussion events and collaborative meals, shaping what an art institution can become from an Indigenous perspective. Meanwhile, Hopkins [https://artreview.com/forge-project-indigenous-self-determination-reimagining-art-pedagogy-candice-hopkins-shanna-ketchum-heap-of-birds-interview/] also secured a $175,000 grant for climate action from the Teiger Foundation, curated a show at the Nanaimo Art Gallery in her home territory of British Columbia and continued as Fellow in Indigenous Art History and Curatorial Studies at CCS Bard.",

Art isn’t always far from these, though with the conclusion of its ‘Transformations of the Human’ programme last year (which supported artist fellows such as Ian Cheng and Anicka Yi), the art-focus has taken a step back (that programme has been spun off into an independent organisation). Though Berggruen’s huge Herzog & de Meuron-designed ‘scholar’s campus’ project in the Santa Monica Mountains has yet to break ground, the institute’s Venice satellite space is now up and running, and in March Berggruen acquired a second palazzo, the future base for Berggruen Arts & Culture, scheduled to open in 2024, with Sterling Ruby currently artist-in-residence.",

On the Boston waterfront the artist placed Last Garment (2022), a bronze sculpture based on a nineteenth-century Jamaican washerwoman. The exhibition travelled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, in November, and a new edition of another Venice work by Leigh, Sentinel (2022), entered the collection of the city’s National Gallery of Art in August. Such institutional acclaim naturally helps the bottom line: in May Leigh’s 2019 bronze Stick sold for a record $2.7m at auction.",

In 2023, while continuing to sit on the board of KW Institute, Stoschek oversaw shows by underknown septuagenarian Black video artist Ulysses Jenkins and emerging South Korean multimedia artist Young-jun Tak, a six-decade survey of video-based performance art and a Hans Ulrich Obrist-curated exploration of the intersection between art and videogames. Meanwhile, after a 2022 marred by revelations of her great-grandfather’s wartime involvement with the Nazi Party, this year Stoschek sought to redirect the narrative forwards, her foundation announcing a long-term resource-sharing collaboration with the Düsseldorf Art Academy. For someone so frequently invested in art’s present and near future, it’s an on-brand move.",

It is ‘a whole world you step into’, consultant Barbara Guggenheim told the Financial Times. She was not just talking about a global reach that spans from Hollywood to Hong Kong to Gstaad to New York, nor the 103 artists and artists’ estates the gallery promotes (veterans William Kentridge, Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/] and Nairy Baghramian joined the roster this year, as well as youngster George Rouy and Michaela Yearwood-Dan). The trio have also established themselves as lifestyle purveyors via their ‘art centres’ in Somerset and Menorca, and, above all, through Iwan and Manuela’s loss-leading Artfarm hospitality company, which owns restaurants, hotels, pubs and, not least, London’s Groucho Club, all adorned with the work of gallery artists.

            "The philosopher, who is known for his erudite observations on the intersections of power, capitalism and identity, and the relationships between these around the world and on the African continent, has become a key reference for artists and curators who are feeling the neoliberal hollowing out of democracy. Mbembe’s most recent book, The Earthly Community (2022), presents the bleak trajectory of technocapitalism, but also posits a possible escape route through African cosmologies and the power of African aesthetics and figurative objects. The author has been touring his book globally and received rave reviews for his radical call for an African future: in June he gave a lecture at the University of Bergen (while receiving the Holberg Prize, the first African to do so), and in November he was billed as the star attraction of the biennial Maputo Fast Forward Festival. In São Paulo for the 9th International Theatre Festival, he told Veja that ‘we must fight to ensure that no person of African descent is a stranger in Africa’, arguing that the continent should institute a right of return.",

            "‘When I was little, I understood that my thoughts were different, and I decided not to live colonized,’ the Chilean artist told Casa Vogue this year. Vicuña suffered as a result, for decades often at the brink of destitution but continuing nonetheless with her knotted textile sculptures, agitprop paintings and poetry. Now the world is eager to listen, what with the eco-feminist and Indigenous turn in artmaking that Vicuña’s work has always embodied. Dreaming Water, one of several recent retrospectives, which opened in Santiago and Buenos Aires last year, arrived at the Pinacoteca of São Paulo in May, while Pérez Art Museum Miami installed a nine-metre quipus, one of the artist’s cascading sculptures of unspun wool. Her work was present in 15 group shows this year, including Pacific Standard Time, California, and two biennials (Malta and Toronto). In addition, the artist presented spoken word performances at venues including Triple Canopy, New York; Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; and Tate Britain, London. In November, Vicuña was awarded $100,000 as a recipient [https://artreview.com/julian-charriere-and-cecilia-vicuna-win-inaugural-environment-and-art-prize/] of the inaugural MoCA Los Angeles Eric and Wendy Schmidt Environment and Art Prize.",

            "This research group, founded in 2010 by Israeli architect Eyal Weizman [https://artreview.com/eyal-weizman-why-aesthetics-must-mean-more-than-beauty/] and consisting of over 20 artists, architects, journalists and researchers who investigate human rights violations, has never been busier. The group has long worked in Palestine, and in January the first exhibition of its Ramallah-based offshoot, the Forensic Architecture Investigation (FAI) Unit, was staged at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Arts and Sciences. The exhibition displayed its trademark analysis of found field recordings, media imagery and satellite pictures, as well as 3D animated reconstructions used to create second-by-second retellings of contested events. The unit, set up in 2020, is a collaboration with Al-Haq, a human rights organisation, but one that has been designated a terrorist group by Israel’s Ministry of Defense, and Forensic Architecture has been the subject of much criticism from commentators, particularly in Germany. Shows at Württembergische Kunstverein Stuttgart and Museum im Kulturspeicher (MiK), Würzburg, both concerning racist and anti-immigration violence in Germany, went ahead, however.\n\nThe methodology they pioneered, in applying aesthetic analysis to news and events, has proven widely influential, while affiliates and former members, including artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan [https://artreview.com/artist/lawrence-abu-hamdan/] and curator Anselm Franke, have spread this further in their own work. Positioning artistic tools and interdisciplinary creative research as means to generate evidence of what they term ‘state and corporate violence’, their work’s proposal of art as something that can be instrumentalised is apparently an alluring one for many artists, suggesting art installation as antidote to an image-dominated, post-truth landscape. The current show at CIVA, Brussels, shows their 2023 work on prehistoric architecture in what is now Ukraine; their work on former plantations in Louisiana, USA, becoming petrochemical factories on view at the Wellcome Collection, London; and a selection of their ongoing work on medical staff in Gaza over the past year being exhibited in Vienna. Alongside museum exhibitions also in Istanbul, Portland and Cali, and biennials in Rotterdam and Yogyakarta, their work continues to have both global focus and audiences.",

Her reach is wide: a new Japanese translation of the writer, thinker and cultural historian’s 2006 book Lose Your Mother won Japan’s Best Translation Award this year. All of this continues to spread her work and her influential methods of delving into archives, exploring their gaps and absences, and reanimating them with both academic rigor and the tools of fiction, what she refers to as ‘critical fabulation’. Her aim in 2019’s Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments [https://artreview.com/can-there-be-history-without-facts-feature-izabella-scott/#:~:text=The%20US%20scholar%20Saidiya%20Hartman], as she wrote, of ‘reconstructing the experience of the unknown and retrieving minor lives from oblivion’ could also be read as a guide for many artists working today.\n\nThis year, while teaching in the English Department at Columbia University and continuing work on a book about unsung heroes of Black radicalism (under the title Graces of the Unsung), and alongside her inclusion in the publication Five Manifestos for the Beautiful World (2024, based on a lecture series from last year), Hartman resumed her ongoing collaboration with artist Arthur Jafa [https://artreview.com/artist/arthur-jafa/?year=2020] through an ambitious three-part multimedia performance, Minor Music at the End of the World. Commissioned by Hartwig Art Foundation and currently in rehearsal, with theorist Tina Campt involved as dramaturg, the production is based on two of Hartman’s essays, ‘The End of White Supremacy: An American Romance’ and ‘Litany for Grieving Sisters’. It also draws on the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, particularly his science fiction story ‘The Comet’, published in 1920 in the wake of the Great Influenza pandemic, in which a black man and a white woman are the sole survivors of an apocalyptic event. Hartman and Jafa’s work will premiere in Amsterdam next year, and the questions it promises to raise testify to Hartman’s conceptual scope and hopefulness: ‘How does one live at the end of the world? Is it possible to envision a world without racism? And what would be required to produce such a world?’",

            "“What could a museum be for the repatriation of objects?” the architect asked at the March Meeting in Sharjah. “What would a museum mean in [Benin]… an extraordinary city with a thousand-year history destroyed in the nineteenth century?” Adjaye is designing the Edo Museum of West African Art, set to open in 2025, as a final rebuke to institutions in the old colonial powers who refuse to hand back looted objects. His words are testament to a design practice that moves beyond merely providing vessels in which others programme, to a far more in-depth approach to museum building. It’s apparent too in the new home he is creating for the storied Studio Museum in Harlem, having honed his understanding of the needs of an institution dedicated to Black thinking and experience not least during the 2016 build of his National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC. Meanwhile, in the UK, Adjaye Associates worked with Theaster Gates to realise the artist’s Serpentine Pavilion, Black Chapel [https://artreview.com/can-theaster-gates-black-chapel-speak-to-a-ravaged-britain/].",

There was however a burgeoning digital art scene making sense of the internet explosion and increasingly accessible computing power. Reas, a student of digital art pioneer John Maeda while he was at MIT, now professor at UCLA, has for two decades explored the juncture of visual art and technology, cofounding the open-source visual design software Processing in 2001. But with the advent of blockchain databases and the NFT explosion, Reas saw the need for a critical and informed platform for the most interesting digital art being made for NFT, which could also support artists financially. The website Feral File, launched in 2020, has become an important showcase for the broad church of net and digital art, with curated exhibitions of work by artists including Zach Blas, Orlan, LaTurbo Avedon and the AI entity Botto – all for sale as NFTs, of course.",

They opened the Muholi Art Institute in Cape Town last year, offering residencies lasting six months to a year, with a stipend, housing and studio costs covered; the fruits of which were featured in an exhibition at Jonathan Carver Moore gallery in San Francisco in June. In February the institute presented a group exhibition, EMBODYING #HER, spotlighting the work of established and emerging women-identifying and queer artists.",

Weems, who was awarded the US National Medal of Arts [https://artreview.com/carrie-mae-weems-awarded-2024-national-medal-of-arts/] by the departing President Biden in October, also revisited The Kitchen Table, her 1990 series of images capturing a fictional drama featuring the artist herself amid scenes of Black American domestic life. She referenced the project in a commission for fashion brand Bottega Veneta, with a campaign showing rapper A$AP Rocky and his baby child sitting down for dinner. Two works from the original series were included in a tv advertisement for Kamala Harris, and Weems produced a billboard for the Democratic presidential candidate, as well as hosting a programme of readings, live music and food at New York’s Gladstone Gallery on election day.",

            "In October luminaries ranging from Malian cultural theorist Manthia Diawara to Argentine artist Tomás Saraceno gathered at London’s Serpentine Galleries to ask: what is underrepresented on the environmental agenda today? What is not yet on the agenda, but will be in the near future? The event was a prelude to next year’s Infinite Ecologies Marathon, marking ten years of climate-focused events organised by Pietroiusti at the Serpentine, and representative of the curator’s belief that art can platform cross-disciplinary ideas on tackling the climate crisis. One of the leading ecologically minded curators, she is a regular on the panel discussion and jury circuit. This year she curated a screening programme for a ‘more-than-human curiosity’ symposium in the Czech Republic, and serves as a trustee of the Gallery Climate Coalition, which includes hundreds of galleries and institutions worldwide. Sun & Sea (Marina) [https://artreview.com/climate-crisis-opera-sun-sea-what-you-do-end-of-world/], the ‘climate change’ opera she curated for the 2019 Lithuanian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, also continues its seemingly never-ending global tour: Taipei, Paris, Cork, Vienna, Buenos Aires, Santiago and Sydney this year.",

Andrew continues as artistic associate of the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, where he is curating a show on global Indigeneity in 2026. There was also a public lightwork for Footscray, a suburb of Melbourne, featuring Andrew’s trademark black-and-white Op-art patterning; and preparations are underway for a second architectural commission, next to Sydney Central station.

How does that square with a country likely to feel the effects of the climate emergency most sharply? It is something the summit addressed head-on with works, curated by Campbell, ranging from Joydeb Roaja’s largescale immersive installation addressing environmental displacement to puppetry performances by children that reflected on climate change. The Samdanis are also establishing the Srihatta, their permanent foundation and sculpture park in rural Bangladesh, delayed but set to open to the public and for artist residencies next year. Away from Bangladesh, Nadia received the Order of Arts and Letters from French Ministry of Culture, and Campbell took control of Desert X in the Coachella Valley in March, again on the climatic beat, linking droughts and floods in California and Bangladesh.",

If the Indonesian collective hoped to return to lives not under constant scrutiny – no such luck: Documenta put out apologetic statements after two members ‘liked’ a social media post depicting a pro-Palestine celebration the day of Hamas’s attack on Israel (Reza Afisina and Iswanto Hartono, both currently visiting professors at the University of Fine Arts Hamburg, also apologised, saying they mistakenly thought the video showed police breaking up the demonstration).

            "Cao came to prominence during the early 2000s as postinternet art thrived. While her videos, performances and, most recently, virtual reality works continue to speak to technological progress and the transformation of China, it is the human experience in all of this that fascinates her the most – and has led to her staying power. ‘I come from the pre-internet era,’ she has said, ‘and what moves me is the relationship formed through emotions, people, objects and the world, not only algorithms and data.’ It is this broadness in her curiosity that registers with audiences, not least those visiting the Lenbachhaus in Munich, where her work explored the relationship between digital culture and the real and virtual worlds. The artist also had solo exhibitions at SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (where the artist transformed the galleries into, for example, a Beijing cinema foyer and a yum cha restaurant, with the help of Hong Kong-based Beau Architects) and Museum of Art Pudong in Shanghai, the last being Cao’s largest to date.",

But Preciado remains, as ever, the intellectual face for the instabilities of gender and biopolitics, and a world that’s in transition. Often cited by artists, Preciado’s work made its way into the Spanish Pavilion [https://artreview.com/venice-biennale-2024-a-guide-to-the-giardini/#:~:text=dense%20and%20captivating-,Spain%20Pavilion,-presents%20hundreds%20of] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] this year, where Sandra Gamarra [https://artreview.com/sandra-gamarra-heshiki-on-representing-spain-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] took a sentence from a lecture by the thinker to accompany a work she had made: ‘trans body is to normative heterosexuality what Palestine is to the West: a colony whose extension and form is perpetuated only through violence’.",

After the pain of her opioid addiction, and the crusade to bring down the Sackler family (museum patrons who made their fortune through the prescription opioid Oxycontin), the photographer was rewarded with a campaign for the fashion brand (an emotional moment, apparently, featuring the likes of Debbie Harry). Alongside her first big-bucks commercial deal was a show of older work presented by Gagosian at the Welsh Chapel in London, while her dealer’s New York space premiered two of her newest moving image works: the apocalyptic You never did anything wrong, in which the models are all animals, and Stendhal Syndrome (both 2024), which pairs personal photographs with portraits of masterpieces from famous museums (now devoid of Sackler sponsorship, naturally). Does this represent a mellowing? Not at all: in October Goldin was arrested outside the New York Stock Exchange [https://artreview.com/nan-goldin-among-artists-arrested-at-jewish-voice-for-peace-action/] while protesting Israel’s bombardment of Palestine.",

This year found the 2020 MacArthur genius-grant awardee taking time out from lecturing on performance studies at NYU (as well as his fellowship at Harvard and other-coast gig at UC Riverside) to lecture on subjects including the poetics of W.E.B. Du Bois and to participate in the Harvard conference ‘Jews and Black Theory: Conceptualizing Otherness’. (In a report on the latter, his performance-inflected keynote was described as a talk that ‘defies summarizing’.) But Moten, who has historically collaborated with artists such as Wu Tsang [https://artreview.com/artist/wu-tsang/], is himself as much a creative maker as a parser of ideas. In 2024, in addition to giving onstage poetry readings (he’s now published ten books of verse), he released and gigged the blacksmiths, the flowers, his second album alongside jazz rhythm section Brandon López and Gerald Cleaver, with Moten – who else – taking care of the words.",

While her Biennale remains a touchstone of how to handle a largescale, in-depth exhibition, this year she has collaborated with various commercial sidelines within spitting distance of the High Line, New York, where she is director. Alemani’s commissions at the latter include work by Pamela Rosenkranz, Yu Ji and Gabriel Chaile, among others. At Gagosian, just a block from the linear sculpture park’s entrance, Alemani curated a Tetsuya Ishida retrospective, featuring more than 80 of the late Japanese artist’s nightmarishly surreal paintings. And a mere two blocks further on, at the old Dia Chelsea premises, Alemani staged an exhibition of work by 70 women artists owned by collectors Komal Shah and Gaurav Garg (which will travel to California’s Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive and the Kemper Art Museum in St Louis). Whether the carbon-footprint-conscious Alemani left Chelsea to sit on the jury of Canada’s Sobey prize [https://artreview.com/kablusiak-wins-2023-sobey-art-award/] is unknown.",

During his leadership at Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, which commenced in January 2023, Ndikung has had to accommodate the institution’s commitment to artists of the Global South, where support for Palestine is high, while being alert to the pro-Israel stance of much of the local audience and media. In November last year, pro-Palestine protesters hung a banner at the entrance to the institution, and in April they interrupted a conference titled ‘Remembering Colonialism’. In the exhibition halls, the Euro 2024 football tournament provided a structure for the museum to reflect on migration, gender and racism in sport. The announcement then that Ndikung will curate the 2025 Bienal de São Paulo [https://artreview.com/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung-to-curate-the-36th-bienal-de-sao-paulo/] under the title Not All Travellers Walk Roads – Of Humanity as Practice offered a welcome relief, with a series of precursor research conferences already underway in Morocco and Guadeloupe.",

We come to fuck shit up.’ That fucking up of shit takes the form of mesmerising films concerning Blackness, death and history. At LUMA Westbau, in Zurich, he remixed his 2013 work APEX, slowing down the original eight-minute video collage to 33 minutes and adding accompanying beats by Detroit techno pioneer Robert Hood. A newfound interest in abstraction was present in LOML (2022), which paid homage to the late writer and musician Greg Tate, shown at the Gwangju Biennale. Meanwhile Melbourne audiences got the greatest hits, including Love is the Message, The Message is Death [https://artreview.com/work-of-the-week-arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message/] (2016), at the Fiona and Sidney Myer Gallery, and last year’s survey [https://artreview.com/a-guide-to-arts-and-culture-this-november/] at OGR Torino closed in February. Meanwhile a collaboration with Supreme became mired in controversy when the fashion brand’s creative director departed, citing the company’s ‘systemic racism’.",

Naturally this is tricky territory, and Attia soon hit controversy after three Iraqi artists, and one of his curatorial team, quit the show over the work of Frenchman Jean-Jacques Lebel and his blowups of the notorious Abu Ghraib prison images [https://artreview.com/art-and-the-limits-of-awareness-politics-berlin-biennale-abu-ghraib/]. Attia apologised, but to no avail. The artist, whose sculpture and installations also deal with postcolonial identity, no doubt found life easier with the day job, closing a solo show at Mathaf, Doha, in March, and exhibiting at the Aichi Triennale in Japan, and in YOYI!

            "Of the 2.8m visitors who came to M+ in Hong Kong last year, its first full year of operation (it opened in 2021 but was closed for periods during the COVID-19 pandemic), Raffel chose to highlight to CNN the older women who use the grounds for group exercise each morning. “The museum is an extension of their lives,” the director said proudly. Those visitors (half of whom are tourists from mainland China; 30 percent are locals) make M+ more popular than Florence’s Uffizi Galleries and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, The Art Newspaper reported. Those who made it into the galleries would have enjoyed chief curator Chong’s programme, which included the first extensive retrospective of architect I.M. Pei [https://artreview.com/red-flags-in-hong-kong-art-scene-report-ilaria-maria-sala/#:~:text=seven%20decades%20of-,I.M.%20Pei%E2%80%99s,-architecture%20%E2%80%93%20although%20Pei], as well as shows celebrating Lee Mingwei, Zhang Peili, Haegue Yang and Apichatpong Weerasethakul [https://artreview.com/artist/apichatpong-weerasethakul/?year=2023], whose seminal video installation Primitive (2009) was shown in Hong Kong [https://artreview.com/the-top-exhibitions-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/#:~:text=through%209%20June-,Apichatpong%20Weerasethakul,-%2C%20M%2B] for the first time. Earlier this year it was reported that West Kowloon Cultural District, of which M+ is something of a flagship, faced a funding shortfall; the authority managed to secure government funding, but continues to look for steady private investment.",

Walker’s European touring show A Black Hole is Everything a Star Longs to Be closed its second stop, at Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt, in January, before opening for Dutch audiences at the De Pont Museum in Tilburg, in July. Australians also got a taste of Walker’s practice, with a show at the National Art Gallery, Canberra, while a survey of her drawings opened at Sprüth Magers, London, in the summer. Although her vast drawings, cutout black paper silhouettes and monumental sculpture ostensibly concentrate on the history of North American race relations and the traumas and resilience of African Americans (and are shown widely across the US, appearing in over 24 group shows this year alone), her influence can be felt beyond her home country, teasing out moments of the Black experience with subtle ease – not least in her recent turn in the Afrofuturism-themed In the Black Fantastic [https://artreview.com/the-past-and-future-of-afrofuturism/] at London’s Hayward Gallery.",

They write, ‘political morality takes time, a patient and courageous way of learning and naming’, a slowness lost in the media churn of outrage and easy condemnation. Considerations such as these come naturally to the Gender Trouble (1990) author and comparative literature professor at UC Berkeley, who remains a champion of queer and gender theory, and who published The Livable and the Unlivable this year (coauthored with Frédéric Worms), a treatise on intersectional care in the face of identity-based and ecological violence. It was these subjects and more that they picked up with a series of speakers – among them philosophers Paul B. Preciado, Elsa Dorlin, Hourya Bentouhami and psychoanalyst Monique David-Ménard – in the first of their events organised as part of being the 2023–24 intellectual-in-residence at the Pompidou in Paris.",

Where the former used to be the purview of rightwing commentators (The Telegraph’s recent frothing at the museum spending £21,000 ‘on discarded avocado trays’, namely Veronica Ryan’s Arrangement In Layers, Stacking Up Moments I–X, 2016–19, felt like a throwback), Balshaw now must keep an eye out for any controversy that might blow up around the perceived ethics of private funders and sponsors (she’s not averse to making the point herself, using her new book, Gathering of Strangers: Why Museums Matter [https://artreview.com/the-unfortunate-ironies-of-maria-balshaws-gathering-of-strangers/], to criticise the British Museum for taking money from BP).

The latter is one of many international startups backed by Worms via his Silicon Valley investment platform, Partech; his contemporary art foundation, Kadist, is just as globally focused. A Woman You Thought You Knew, which brought together works from the Kadist collection, was staged at the nonprofit’s gallery in San Francisco, while its Paris gallery boasted a programme that featured an evening of performances inspired by medieval French poetry, Manthia Diawara and Hoor Al Qasimi [https://artreview.com/artist/sheikha-hoor-al-qasimi/] in conversation, and a group show of Ukrainian artists in collaboration with the Palais de Tokyo. Partech Africa is the largest fund dedicated to African startups, and Kadist has been increasingly present on the continent. It supported the annual exhibition Dig Where You Stand, which this year took place in two cities in Benin (Cotonou and Ouidah), and in November staged a festival at Fondation H in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.",

Mousse magazine even cited her when announcing its redesign this year. Though it has been a quiet year for publishing, with limited public speaking beyond her professor emerita role at the History of Consciousness department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, it’s understandable why she remains such a touchstone: her writing addresses so many of our current issues, from the environment, to gender and queer identity, to AI and tech. Haraway’s thinking is nothing if not intersectional: regarding her papal citation, coming despite her long history of criticising the Catholic Church, she quipped, ‘Some baby Jesuit who’s into animal studies and science studies and feminist theory for some weird reason has been reading me’. They’re not alone.",

Lee’s approach, which has focused on organising prominent international exhibitions, including collateral shows at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], made their name – as well as her own. Now that Seoul has become a major node in the art market, Lee, whose gallery was founded in 1982 and represents approximately 50 artists, including Haegue Yang and the newly signed eighty-nine-year-old sculptor Kim Yun Shin (featured in this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/]), is more ambivalent about how helpful artworld hype can be. ‘I think we should not be “too excited” about the Korean art scene being globally recognized, becoming another art hub in Asia… Both galleries and artists should stay on their toes,’ she warned The Korea Herald. Now a family affair, with Lee’s children involved, Kukje is no doubt in it for the long haul.",

            "Kouoh [https://artreview.com/talk-the-talk-on-koyo-kouoh-and-the-state-of-curating/] told Artforum in August that there is an ‘energy of Pan-Africanism that is being revived on the continent and across its vast diaspora’. At least in part, the growing mightiness of the African artworld is down to the curator’s own efforts. As the director of Cape Town’s Zeitz MOCAA since 2019, and having established her name through the RAW Material Company in Senegal, Kouoh has become a leading light at home and abroad. Current shows at the institution include solos for Ghanaian-American artist Rita Mawuena Benissan [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-november-2024/#:~:text=Rita%20Mawuena%20Benissan] and South African Nolan Oswald Dennis. Earlier this year, Kunstmuseum Basel opened When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting [https://artreview.com/a-century-of-black-figuration-in-painting-review/], a survey exhibition curated by Kouoh that debuted at Zeitz. Not that it has all been plain sailing: in June, the artist Tracey Rose lambasted Kouoh and Kunstmuseum Bern, claiming that a work about Palestine had been censored [https://artreview.com/kunstmuseum-bern-hosting-tracey-rose-retrospective-branded-despicable-by-artist/] in her solo show at the Swiss institution, curated by Kouoh. Earlier this year, Kouoh oversaw Zeitz MOCAA’s annual gala, the proceeds of which help fund its educational and curatorial programming.",

The Financial Times agreed: ‘Pedrosa’s thoughtful, serious approach showcases the joys and opportunities, as well as the trauma, of displacement and marvellously balances aesthetic pleasure and politics.’ Yet opinion was far from unanimous: the works on show, The Art Newspaper thought, ‘measured by technical rather [than] representative properties, are, frankly, ropey’; Folha de S.Paulo complained that Pedrosa ‘reduced the artists to slogans’. Pedrosa’s interest in identity will be familiar to visitors of Museu de Arte de São Paulo, where he is director (with an extension into neighbouring premises opening in March), where he uses a different theme every year to programme.

            "‘My interest is always to break down the distance between what we think [of] as art or high art and what we do in our daily life,’ Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] once told The Korea Herald. During his close-to-40-year engagement with what has been characterised as relational aesthetics, the Thai artist has become known for his participatory events, from cooking pad thai for gallery goers to providing them with ping-pong tables. You’d think it might be tricky to encapsulate such a career in a retrospective, but his MoMA PS1 survey, which closed in March, before moving to LUMA Arles in June, had a go, as did a second retrospective at Gropius Bau, Berlin, which opened in September, serving curry and Turkish coffees, and providing hangout spaces where the interactions are the work.\n\nGiven the social aspect of his practice, it is unsurprising that Tiravanija hasn’t hidden himself away in his studio: he has also established himself as a consummate curator. Building on his curating of the triennial Okayama Art Summit in 2022 and cocurating of the Thailand Biennale in 2023 [https://artreview.com/thailand-biennale-2023-the-open-world-chiang-rai-review/], he oversaw this year’s edition of Art Spectrum, a biennial exhibition featuring the next generation of Asian artists, including Heecheon Kim [https://artreview.com/heecheon-kim-keeping-it-real/], Riar Rizaldi [https://artreview.com/riar-rizaldis-theory-of-many-worlds/] and Vivien Zhang, which was held at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul. You might see the last, which was as diverse as it was intriguing, as an extension of the artist’s ongoing teaching activities (at Columbia University, New York) and his support of Gallery Ver, a commercial gallery space in his native Thailand. One thing’s for sure though, Tiravanija is as open and generous to other artists as he is to those who attend and at times become a part of his exhibitions; even if repetitive, it is effective, offering a form of openness that feels increasingly relevant to artists, given the fractious nature of our current times. Amidst everything else, Tiravanija also found time to contribute two new works to this year’s Forest Festival [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-september-2024/#:~:text=of%20Arata%20Isozaki-,Forest%20Festival%20of%20the%20Arts%20Okayama,-Various%20venues%2C%20Okayama] in Okayama (which included a series of textile works and ceramic bowls, offering visitors a lunchbox filled with locally sourced ingredients), an exhibition in Montreal, where he hosted a rehearsal space for local bands, as well as a roomsize installation at Pilar Corrias in London, just in time for Frieze Week.",

His big hits might be behind him (for now at least), but the voracious mingling of art, architecture, ecology and new technology continues unabated. A solo exhibition at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, which featured old classics as well as new commissions (including Under the Weather, 2022, a huge elliptical patterned screen hanging above the building’s courtyard that changes as the viewer moves about), was also a chance to launch a trippy ever-changing colour-field virtual-reality NFT (commissioned by Beeple collector Metakovan). The artist’s aim – whether he’s producing gallery shows (in Seoul, Madrid, Los Angeles), institutional exhibitions (additional solos at Castello di Rivoli and Munich’s Pinakothek), largescale outdoor commissions (for a Californian winery, or in the Qatari desert) or magazine covers (produced for Time ahead of COP27) – is to make the viewer acutely aware of their – and the – environment.",

            "Speaking to The Korea Times during the opening of Correspondence: Lee Ufan and Mark Rothko at Pace’s Seoul branch, CEO Glimcher was in a philosophical mood. ‘Artists are creating something that’s purely of the spirit, but we’re hoping someone will actually spend money on it. And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

As the former member of the Italian Communist Party told Vogue this year, family takes up another third, while the rest of her time is devoted to ‘culture and the Fondazione’. The Venice-and-Milan-based private institution is no trinket (with Tokyo and Shanghai project spaces), and Prada is very hands-on, telling Vogue how she struggled to find a curator who would fully embrace her vision of a future show on feminism. She did, however, get the likes of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler to curate Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Technology and Power, 1500–2025, a Marx-tinged show on tech and power that closed in January; while Meriem Bennani installed a solo exhibition in Milan, Christoph Büchel [https://artreview.com/christoph-buchel-monte-di-pieta-fondazione-prada-venice-biennale/] in Venice, Michaël Borremans in China and Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin in Japan.",

Last year Sandretto Re Rebaudengo was named president of Fondazione Arte CRT, which supplies loans and new work to the Turin Civic Gallery (GAM) and Castello di Rivoli, as well as site-specific commissions for OGR Torino, and has since doubled the foundation’s annual acquisitions budget to €1m. The patron, whose Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo has amassed a collection of more than 1,500 artworks, has long had exhibition spaces in Turin and neighbouring Guarene, but in recent years she’s been expanding her reach: she’s turning a Venetian island into an art centre (set to open next year), and the Madrid wing of the Fondazione is now homing in on a permanent HQ. Sandretto also sits on committees at New York’s MoMA, New Museum and CCS Bard, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, London’s Tate Modern, Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum and Barcelona’s Fundación MACBA, among others. At her eponymous Turin foundation meanwhile, she gave solo shows to The Otolith Group, Stefanie Heinze and Bekhbaatar Enkhtur.",

            "A promotion for Tan this year: after 11 years as director of the National Gallery Singapore (NGS), while also directing Singapore Art Museum (SAM) since 2019, he became CEO of both institutions in April. The advancement added another asset to his portfolio: the STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery. Three months later, a partnership deal was announced between NGS, where 70 percent of the collection is dedicated to Singaporean artists and 30 percent to Southeast Asian artists, and the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts to encourage loans, research partnerships and residency programmes. The 2024 exhibitions programme at NGS featured a retrospective of Kim Lim and shows for Cheong Soo Pieng, pioneer of the Nanyang art style, and centenarian Lim Tze Peng, Singapore’s oldest living and active artist. Meanwhile, Pratchaya Phinthong and Yee I-Lann received shows at SAM which also supported the organisation of Robert Zhao Renhui’s Singaporean Pavilion [https://artreview.com/robert-zhao-renhui-on-representing-singapore-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] (NGS also made a substantial loan of eight works to the Biennale’s International Pavilion [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/], curated by Adriano Pedrosa [https://artreview.com/artist/adriano-pedrosa/?year=2024]).",

It is not just the high profile at home that marks out the gallery, but the global network that its geographically-diverse artist roster has firmly infiltrated. Wilfredo Prieto represented Cuba at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], while WangShui, Bárbara Sánchez-Kane [https://artreview.com/barbara-sanchez-kane-new-lexicons-for-embodiment-kurimanzutto-new-york-review/] and Ana Segovia were in the main show; Haegue Yang [https://artreview.com/artist/haegue-yang/] showed in London and Chicago; Minerva Cuevas exhibited at CC Foundation, Shanghai; and the gallery worked with peers Shibunkaku for a presentation at Art Collaborations Kyoto. Kurimanzutto’s satellite space in New York gives them clout there, too: this year, the Met installed specially commissioned architectural interventions by Nairy Baghramian and Petrit Halilaj, and in February the gallery announced the representation of the estate of the late New York icon John Giorno.",

The artist had removed her work from Documenta in 2022 [https://artreview.com/hito-steyerl-says-she-has-no-faith-in-documenta-tackling-antisemitism/] due to what she perceived as inaction by its curators over antisemitism, and was scathing of many of her peers who had publicly criticised Israel, telling The Guardian that many were merely practising ‘art as social media performance’. Furthermore, she bemoaned that it was those who only condemn violence on one side ‘that dominate the debate’. Steyerl’s engagement with the conflict comes as no surprise: questions of power, violence and mediation have been her subject matter for two decades now, parlayed into her video essays and multimedia installations. This year she premiered three new works that take the Nord Stream oil pipeline system as their subject at the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, and settled into her new role as professor in Emergent Digital Media at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

            "Artist, curator, institutional director – Al Qasimi can claim to belong to nearly every constituent sector of the artworld (albeit these days she’s not really that well known for her painting). Plus, in the real world, she’s royalty. And yet, in recent years she has leveraged her expertise and knowledge of art from the Gulf region and further afield, to operate in geographies beyond the Emirate and areas in which she can absolutely rely on royal privilege. An exhibition of paintings she curated by the senior Māori artist Emily Karaka, which opened this autumn at the Sharjah Art Foundation, of which she is also president and founding director, may be indicative of the direction planned for the 2026 Biennale of Sydney [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-lead-the-2026-biennale-of-sydney/]. Al Qasimi was this year appointed curator of the Australian survey, which she will work on while developing her plans for the 2025 Aichi Triennale [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-direct-aichi-triennale-2025/] in Japan, of which she is artistic director (the first non-Japanese person to occupy the position, although she speaks the language, having studied there). Having previously curated the Lahore Biennale (in 2020) and the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Al Qasimi is in demand, and her global presence is reflected in her home institution’s programming, which, in addition to Karaka, has featured survey exhibitions of South African multimedia icon William Kentridge, Brazilian painter Antonio Dias and Pakistani artist and Women’s Action Forum cofounder Lala Rukh, not to mention the annual March Meeting [https://artreview.com/the-top-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-march-2024/#:~:text=March%20Meeting%202024%3A%20Tawashujat] conference. Next February marks the opening of the 16th Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/] (Al Qasimi curated the 2023 edition [https://artreview.com/artists-for-2023-sharjah-biennial-revealed/], developing a programme initiated by the late Okwui Enwezor, having been involved with the event – as director – since 2003, when she cocurated the sixth edition). For this edition, Al Qasimi has appointed an all-female team of curators [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] that includes many of the leading lights among curators operating in the context of the global majority, including Sri Lanka’s Natasha Ginwala [https://artreview.com/artist/natasha-ginwala/], Indonesian curator Alia Swastika [https://artreview.com/artist/alia-swastika/?year=2024], Bahraini-Singaporean artist Amal Khalaf, New Zealand artist Megan Tamati-Quennell and Turkish curator Zeynep Öz. Moreover, in the context of an artworld in which cancellations and boycotts are rife – coming from every direction – and generating a consequent culture of fear, Al Qasimi remains one of the few voices still prepared to use the platform art (and royal privilege) affords them in order to express their opinions directly and to keep discussions that most people allow to fade away firmly in the spotlight, whether they concern the current carnage in Palestine and Lebanon or those suffering from other conflicts across the globe. Beyond all that, Al Qasimi also serves as president of the International Biennale Association, president of the hugely influential Africa Institute in Sharjah and on the board of Ashkal Alwan in Beirut. She is also on the advisory boards of the Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi and Darat al Funun in Amman. Beyond her involvement with art, she also founded the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, and earlier this year presented a clothing collection in London which was developed from the work of her late brother, who worked in the fashion industry. But beyond her personal achievements, Al Qasimi is also a symbol of the increasing influence of the Gulf region in the spheres of finance, commerce, politics, sports and entertainment, and, of course (but perhaps primarily by virtue of the first two elements on this list) art.",

Organised chronologically and installed, as always, by the artist and his team (over 16 days and nights, he says), it provided an easy image of the photographer’s journey from nightclub imagery to a more wide-ranging experimentation in representing the world around him (and beyond: astronomy is a passion). Meanwhile, Fragile, a show touring African cities over the past five years, arrived at its final stop across two venues in Lagos; his solo at Mumok, Vienna, closed after an extended run in August. And then Tillmans was back in London for a round of fundraising on behalf of the ICA, where he has been chair since 2019. Demonstrating that his penchant for hedonism isn’t over, Tillmans outlined plans to make the art institution party central, including a licence to serve alcohol until 6am.",

His sculpture was the focal point of a survey that opened in May at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, materially derived from dilapidated architecture and the urban realm, and specifically informed by Freedmen’s Town in Houston’s Fourth Ward. With regards to the latter, Gates is advising an initiative that plans to preserve this historic neighbourhood built and shaped by Black people following emancipation: an endeavour that’s in the mould of the socially engaged mini-empire he has been building on the South Side of Chicago since 2006. Over in Tokyo, the artist’s Afro-Mingei exhibition at the Mori Art Museum, which imagined ‘the artistic possibilities of combining Black aesthetics and Japanese craft philosophies to envision hybrid-culture futures’, laid the groundwork for incense and sake collaborations with small family-owned businesses in Japan. This mix of commerce and creativity made him an obvious choice for Prada’s diversity council, where Gates has spearheaded a mentorship programme for designers of colour.",

            "Following on from several years of more hard-hitting, London-focused film projects – including the 2020 Small Axe series of five films that charted the lives of West Indian immigrants to the city, codirecting the documentary Uprising (2021) on a 1981 fire in South London, and his filmic monument Grenfell [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-will-not-look-away-serpentine-gallery-london/] (2023), a single-shot circling of the site of the tragic 2017 apartment block fire – the gap between McQueen’s art and cinema projects feels wider of late. This year, McQueen received a solo exhibition that continues to occupy both Dia sites in New York, with several film works and a new photographic series on display in the institution’s Chelsea space, and in a massive former factory site Beacon is his new installation Bass, the basement space filled only with coloured lighting and reverberating with snatches of music (The music an extended jam session, recorded in-situ, between different forms of the titular instrument, played by a stellar ensemble that included Meshell Ndegeochello and jazz veteran Marcus Miller.) The show received widespread acclaim, and will travel to Switzerland’s Schaulager next year. He also released the documentary Occupied City [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-review/], in which he slowly traced and filmed all the locations that appear in author, historian and producer (and McQueen’s wife) Bianca Stigter’s book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940–1945 (2019). Offering a meditative study of the Dutch capital under the Nazis, it was a cinematic tour de force that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.\n\nSo far, so auteur. McQueen’s second celluloid outing this year, Blitz, however, which opened to mixed reviews, demonstrated how mainstream he can go. Telling the story of a young boy during the World War II bombing of London, it was ‘an old-fashioned children’s adventure movie, a rollicking yarn that might have been on television on a Bank Holiday afternoon’, thought the BBC. ‘Shockingly conventional’, Variety noted. But McQueen seems confident straddling both documentary and fiction forms, as well as arthouse and (attempted) blockbuster modes, and continues to serve as a model to artists who might want to make work that can occupy the gallery, the cinema, as well as home streaming platforms.",

Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

Serve the Dominant Ideology or Stop Being a Pussy, Frances Stark’s first exhibition with the gallery since her old home, Gavin Brown’s enterprise, folded into Gladstone in 2020, opened in June and featured 12 paintings of open books. Another astute commentator on the artworld, artist David Salle, and the lucrative estate of Robert Rauschenberg also joined the gallery’s roster this year. With locations in New York, Brussels and Seoul [https://artreview.com/gladstone-gallery-to-open-new-seoul-space/], and artists ranging from Matthew Barney [https://artreview.com/matthew-barney-secondary-no-pain-no-gain/] to Marisa Merz and Rachel Rose (all of whom had shows), as well as the likes of Rirkrit Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] and Sarah Lucas (who have had significant shows elsewhere this year), Gladstone has colossal spread.

            "A decade since its conception and three years after opening, Hoffmann’s 11-hectare, eight-venue art campus LUMA Arles continues both to wow first-time visitors and to impress with its restless, conscious exhibition programming and food culture. This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

A serial biennial curator, who also hops nimbly between the worlds of public institutions and private foundations, Gioni is artistic director of the Beatrice Trussardi Foundation in his native Italy and the curator of Dark Light: Realism in the Age of Post-Truth at the Aïshti Foundation in Beirut, which featured over 200 works from the collection of Tony and Elham Salamé and focused on the changing meanings of figuration in contemporary art. Proving he can also nip between the worlds of fashion and art, in Doha he is the cocurator of the current Valentino show, Forever Valentino, and, earlier this year, the Jeff Koons survey Lost in America.",

Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

            "Lowry became MoMA director in 1995, then a forty-year-old Islamic art scholar, and he will leave next year [https://artreview.com/moma-director-glen-lowry-to-step-down-after-30-years/] as someone who turned the role into something closer to that of a CEO. His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

            "‘An institution is a learning system’, Obrist told Forbes this year while discussing the ‘Year of AI’ at London’s Serpentine Galleries. Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
