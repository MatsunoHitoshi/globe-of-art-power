All the countries had artists representing them at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] who have passed through London’s very own United Nations, the Delfina Foundation. More alumni of the exhibition and residency programmes – directed by Cezar for the past 17 years – including the likes of Manauara Clandestina, Dana Awartani, Lydia Ourahmane, Ali Cherri, Larissa Sansour and Ahmet Öğüt, could be found in the Biennale’s main show [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/] and collateral events. This year, Cezar could also be seen across the world, from a talks programme in India to a gin brand launch during Hong Kong’s Art Week: not only is he scouting for talent, but also on the lookout for £7m, the amount needed to secure the institution’s future since the death of its patron and founder, Delfina Entrecanales, in 2022. Meanwhile in London, two shows: a five-artist exhibition curated by Dominican artist Yina Jiménez Suriel and solo exhibitions for Indian artist Soumya Sankar Bose [https://artreview.com/soumya-sankar-bose-in-search-of-lost-time/] and Myanmar artist Moe Satt.",

            "Every Step in the Right Direction, the title Flores has given the Singapore Biennale 2019 (of which he is the artistic director), is taken from the revolutionary fighter Salud Algabre, who resisted US occupation of the Philippines. Flores has described the biennial as an opportunity to extend the process of reimagining Southeast Asia independently of its construction by colonial powers. The Filipino curator certainly isn’t resting on his laurels, combining his responsibilities as curator of the Jorge B. Vargas Museum and Filipiniana Research Center of the University of the Philippines in Manila, where he is also a professor, with a role as adjunct curator at the National Gallery Singapore. In his work at the latter institution, as at the biennial, he has resisted the trends towards spectacular gestures in favour of an idea of lasting change as effected through ‘time, patience and sustained commitment’. Which combination of positive mental attitude and elbow grease might explain why he’s moving in the right direction on this list.",

            "Spivak is one of the most influential postcolonial thinkers and activists, whose work as a theorist and critic has ceaselessly campaigned against intellectual colonisation in a globalised world. Her 1988 essay ‘Can the Subaltern Speak?’, which tackled problems of representation and agency in formerly colonised countries, continues to be a key point of reference within postcolonial studies, and in recent years her influence has grown beyond academia and into an artworld that is attempting to decolonise its practices and institutions, becoming a lodestone for curators and artists working in the field. Advocating for the importance of the humanities in the redress of the economically dispossessed and marginalised, Spivak also runs the Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty Memorial Rural Education Project, which she founded in 1986 to fund and provide high standards of teaching in primary schools in her home state of West Bengal. She is currently a professor at Columbia University, where she cofounded the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

While the walls of the museum back then were dominated by art by white people, Joyner is determined to use the wealth she has accrued through a career in finance to collect and lend the work of Black artists. This year Joyner donated 31 paintings, sculptures and drawings by 20 American artists from the African diaspora to SFMoMA (where she is a trustee, alongside board positions at MoMA, the J. Paul Getty Trust, Tate Americas and the Chicago Art Institute). The works were selected by Joyner to plug gaps in SFMoMA’s collection, offering new, more inclusive readings of art history. ‘What I want visitors to take away is that there were people of colour not only working in the field,’ Joyner said this year, ‘but defining the character of the movement at that time.’",

The feminist artist – whose early ‘inflammatory essays’ were fly-posted across New York, who has commissioned billboards, projected slogans onto buildings and used a major newspaper supplement to highlight the wartime abuse of women – has spent four decades pioneering ways to reach audiences beyond the artworld and to effect change within it. In 2018 this took the form of the Anti-Gun Truck, which, adorned with phrases such as ‘Duck and Cover’ and ‘Too Late Now’, toured the US. Her influence was recognised in the adaptation of her ‘truism’ that the ‘Abuse of Power Comes as No Surprise’ by pressure group We Are Not Surprised. Whether or not those efforts have long-term impacts, Holzer will continue to offer a model for art as direct action.",

It emerged, meanwhile, that while Sharp and Slotover retain a 30 percent share in Frieze, they have the option to cash in next year. Yet this corporate wrangling didn’t affect action in the aisles: while the New York event hasn’t recaptured the excitement attending its debut, it did avoid the weather calamities that have blighted recent editions; London sales were reportedly brisk; and the celeb-filled inaugural venture into Los Angeles was judged successful.",

He created Listening All Night to the Rain, a disorientating walk-through featuring 62 screens that played 31 hours of footage and archival material, with references ranging from Stokely Carmichael to Mark Rothko, and which meditated on the artist’s enduring themes of memory, migration, racial injustice and climate change, while asking audiences to ‘attune’ to an ‘ethics of sonics’ that served as the installation’s narrative. Akomfrah’s interest in the formal texture of filmmaking, as much as its social and political message, was honed not least during his years as a member of the Black Audio Film Collective (with former members David Lawson and Lina Gopaul still working alongside him). The Independent thought the Pavilion was ‘a visual feast, exploring the best and worst of our country at a time when the notion of British identity has never been so contested’.",

As founding director of the Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), her approach to connecting artists and curators from Southeast Asia with their global peers was exemplified by Arus Balik – From below the wind to above the wind and back again, an ‘exhibition project’ that sprang from a conversation between curator Philippe Pirotte and Jakarta-based artist Ade Darmawan, and ended in a sprawling group show. Her interest in ecological themes, archival practices and collaborative models was, meanwhile, reflected in an exhibition of the late Jef Geys’s work. It was no surprise then that Bauer was among the ‘search committee’ that in February announced the appointment of Indonesian collective ruangrupa as curator of the next Documenta.",

Recent #MeToo allegations against Komu (posted on anonymous Instagram account @herdsceneand), however, have taken something of the shine off. Komu swiftly stood down from his post as secretary of the Kochi Biennale Foundation pending an investigation, and Dube, the biennial’s first woman curator (of this December’s fourth iteration), issued a statement saying, ‘I take the issue of women’s empowerment… seriously. It informs my curatorial deliberations and I try to practice what I preach’, while at the same time suggesting that the biennial itself was undergoing a ‘process of structural change’. That Kerala has experienced its worst flooding (483 recorded deaths) in almost a century may also have extended the biennial’s focus beyond Dube’s stated ambition to examine resistance to the influence of capital and spectacle on contemporary culture.",

From cofounding the magazine Revue Noire (1991–2001, at a time when, he recalls, many European gallerists ‘insisted that contemporary art did not exist in Africa’), to his groundbreaking Africa Remix show in the mid-2000s, Njami has been a key figure in the battle to recentre (and decentre) the narrative of contemporary art in and from Africa. For Njami, constantly travelling between the continent’s growing art scenes, supporting the institutional cultures and networks necessary for getting art shown and circulated, are as important as the art itself; for Dak’Art he invited curators from Hong Kong to Mexico to curate international sections, while his Kampala Art Biennale in August brought established artists to set up studio in the Ugandan capital, to mentor groups of ‘apprentice’ artists.",

Under the duo, the Madrid institution has a more radical intent (Fernandes was a high-profile communist activist in his youth) at a time, Borja-Villel noted this year, when capitalism risks reducing audiences to ‘consuming and obedient automata’. Consequently, alongside the 21,000-strong collection (including, in keeping with the insurrectionary rhetoric, Pablo Picasso’s Guernica), the museum boasted an eclectic programme of names whose work is not necessarily ubiquitous on the national-museum circuit. Historical surveys this year included the early-twentieth-century American cartoonist George Herriman (best known for Krazy Kat, 1913–44), Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, Spanish kinetic art pioneer Eusebio Sempere and the phenomenon of Russian Dada; on the contemporary side, the work of conceptualist Dora García, formalist Nairy Baghramian and activist Artur Barrio were also profiled in solo exhibitions.",

At once belated and timely, the survey was recognition of a career spanning five decades in which Piper has harnessed a fierce intellect and sharp wit to the production of work with considerable political clout. The American-born, Berlin-based philosopher and conceptual artist, who hasn’t set foot in the US since learning in 2005 that she was on a US watch list for ‘suspicious travellers’, seeks to expose the infrastructures through which racism is exercised. As such she is an influence on a generation of artists increasingly inclined to mix media and modes of display in exploring the intersections of class and colour, art and the real world. Famously unwilling to suffer fools, notably ill-informed journalists, Piper offers an example of how an artist can use the discourse around her work to reinforce the very points about (mis)representation that it makes.",

While her videos, performances and, most recently, virtual reality works continue to speak to technological progress and the transformation of China, it is the human experience in all of this that fascinates her the most – and has led to her staying power. ‘I come from the pre-internet era,’ she has said, ‘and what moves me is the relationship formed through emotions, people, objects and the world, not only algorithms and data.’ It is this broadness in her curiosity that registers with audiences, not least those visiting the Lenbachhaus in Munich, where her work explored the relationship between digital culture and the real and virtual worlds. The artist also had solo exhibitions at SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (where the artist transformed the galleries into, for example, a Beijing cinema foyer and a yum cha restaurant, with the help of Hong Kong-based Beau Architects) and Museum of Art Pudong in Shanghai, the last being Cao’s largest to date.",

            "The philosopher and curator [https://artreview.com/the-interview-paul-b-preciado-orlando-virginia-woolf/] made his first foray into film with his experimental production Orlando, My Political Biography (2023), which gained wider theatrical releases throughout 2024. ‘A political work that wears its seriousness very lightly,’ wrote Sight and Sound, ‘and its lightness very seriously indeed.’ Preciado’s book Dysphoria Mundi, published in Spanish in 2023, will come out in an English translation in early 2025 (the hybrid essayistic outing was written during the COVID-19 lockdown and considers dysphoria as a defining aspect of current life). But Preciado remains, as ever, the intellectual face for the instabilities of gender and biopolitics, and a world that’s in transition. Often cited by artists, Preciado’s work made its way into the Spanish Pavilion [https://artreview.com/venice-biennale-2024-a-guide-to-the-giardini/#:~:text=dense%20and%20captivating-,Spain%20Pavilion,-presents%20hundreds%20of] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] this year, where Sandra Gamarra [https://artreview.com/sandra-gamarra-heshiki-on-representing-spain-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] took a sentence from a lecture by the thinker to accompany a work she had made: ‘trans body is to normative heterosexuality what Palestine is to the West: a colony whose extension and form is perpetuated only through violence’.",

            "‘The greatest love that the human species has attained was on a Gucci shoot, when I was shooting a trans couple making love,’ Goldin proclaimed in October. After the pain of her opioid addiction, and the crusade to bring down the Sackler family (museum patrons who made their fortune through the prescription opioid Oxycontin), the photographer was rewarded with a campaign for the fashion brand (an emotional moment, apparently, featuring the likes of Debbie Harry). Alongside her first big-bucks commercial deal was a show of older work presented by Gagosian at the Welsh Chapel in London, while her dealer’s New York space premiered two of her newest moving image works: the apocalyptic You never did anything wrong, in which the models are all animals, and Stendhal Syndrome (both 2024), which pairs personal photographs with portraits of masterpieces from famous museums (now devoid of Sackler sponsorship, naturally). Does this represent a mellowing? Not at all: in October Goldin was arrested outside the New York Stock Exchange [https://artreview.com/nan-goldin-among-artists-arrested-at-jewish-voice-for-peace-action/] while protesting Israel’s bombardment of Palestine.",

This year found the 2020 MacArthur genius-grant awardee taking time out from lecturing on performance studies at NYU (as well as his fellowship at Harvard and other-coast gig at UC Riverside) to lecture on subjects including the poetics of W.E.B. Du Bois and to participate in the Harvard conference ‘Jews and Black Theory: Conceptualizing Otherness’. (In a report on the latter, his performance-inflected keynote was described as a talk that ‘defies summarizing’.) But Moten, who has historically collaborated with artists such as Wu Tsang [https://artreview.com/artist/wu-tsang/], is himself as much a creative maker as a parser of ideas. In 2024, in addition to giving onstage poetry readings (he’s now published ten books of verse), he released and gigged the blacksmiths, the flowers, his second album alongside jazz rhythm section Brandon López and Gerald Cleaver, with Moten – who else – taking care of the words.",

This last triggered the sacking of Gagosian director Sam Orlofsky after it published various allegations against the gallerist (who has not responded).

While her Biennale remains a touchstone of how to handle a largescale, in-depth exhibition, this year she has collaborated with various commercial sidelines within spitting distance of the High Line, New York, where she is director. Alemani’s commissions at the latter include work by Pamela Rosenkranz, Yu Ji and Gabriel Chaile, among others. At Gagosian, just a block from the linear sculpture park’s entrance, Alemani curated a Tetsuya Ishida retrospective, featuring more than 80 of the late Japanese artist’s nightmarishly surreal paintings. And a mere two blocks further on, at the old Dia Chelsea premises, Alemani staged an exhibition of work by 70 women artists owned by collectors Komal Shah and Gaurav Garg (which will travel to California’s Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive and the Kemper Art Museum in St Louis). Whether the carbon-footprint-conscious Alemani left Chelsea to sit on the jury of Canada’s Sobey prize [https://artreview.com/kablusiak-wins-2023-sobey-art-award/] is unknown.",

It has inspired (presumably) welcome imitators (including Vacation in New York and Okey Dokey in Germany’s Rhineland) and made Carlos a regular on the conference circuit. Back in London, besides the day job of running Carlos/Ishikawa (and the careers of artists including Korakrit Arunanondchai, Oscar Murillo and Evelyn Taocheng Wang), she emerged, late last year, as a vocal spokesperson for We Are Not Surprised, the pressure group highlighting abuse and misogyny in the artworld. The act of deconstructing power makes one, ironically, pretty powerful.",

It is a neat bit of subversion, then, that it is also the weapon wielded by Forensic Architecture – Weizman’s collective of researchers, architects and journalists – against those same bodies. The collective’s exhibition schedule this year included the Whitney Biennial and the Chicago Architecture Biennial: in New York, Weizman’s team investigated the use of teargas manufactured by Safariland, the CEO of which was, not coincidentally, vice chairman of the Whitney’s board (he has since stepped down). At the architecture biennial, the collective presented a work piecing together the events leading up to the death of Harith Augustus, killed by Chicago police in 2018. For a show at Ujazdowski Castle in Warsaw in March, the group unveiled its newest division: the Centre for Contemporary Nature, conducting investigations into environmental crimes in Palestine and Colombia.",

This staple object, used by the artist for nearly 20 years, framed a videowork in which she revisits the abandoned house that served as the venue for her first solo exhibition in South Korea in 2006. Featuring an installation formed from drying racks, origami pieces and light fixtures, that historic – and self-initiated – show set the tone for a career in which the architectural detritus of the everyday has been used to poetically reference art historical moments, political events or folk rituals. The Hayward exhibition garnered a one-star review in The Guardian but plenty of praise elsewhere: Yang’s fans are legion, demonstrated by the fact that the London exhibition wasn’t her only museum outing this year. She received a survey show, titled Flat Works, of collages, prints and paintings spanning two decades at the Arts Club of Chicago, and was included in the Lahore Biennale as well as group exhibitions at Secession, Vienna, and MoMA, New York, among others.",

We come to fuck shit up.’ That fucking up of shit takes the form of mesmerising films concerning Blackness, death and history. At LUMA Westbau, in Zurich, he remixed his 2013 work APEX, slowing down the original eight-minute video collage to 33 minutes and adding accompanying beats by Detroit techno pioneer Robert Hood. A newfound interest in abstraction was present in LOML (2022), which paid homage to the late writer and musician Greg Tate, shown at the Gwangju Biennale. Meanwhile Melbourne audiences got the greatest hits, including Love is the Message, The Message is Death [https://artreview.com/work-of-the-week-arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message/] (2016), at the Fiona and Sidney Myer Gallery, and last year’s survey [https://artreview.com/a-guide-to-arts-and-culture-this-november/] at OGR Torino closed in February. Meanwhile a collaboration with Supreme became mired in controversy when the fashion brand’s creative director departed, citing the company’s ‘systemic racism’.",

Naturally this is tricky territory, and Attia soon hit controversy after three Iraqi artists, and one of his curatorial team, quit the show over the work of Frenchman Jean-Jacques Lebel and his blowups of the notorious Abu Ghraib prison images [https://artreview.com/art-and-the-limits-of-awareness-politics-berlin-biennale-abu-ghraib/]. Attia apologised, but to no avail. The artist, whose sculpture and installations also deal with postcolonial identity, no doubt found life easier with the day job, closing a solo show at Mathaf, Doha, in March, and exhibiting at the Aichi Triennale in Japan, and in YOYI! Care, Repair, Heal at Gropius Bau, Berlin.",

            "When Marshall painted A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self in 1980, it protested the lack of Black faces to be found in figurative art: the face staring out is entirely in silhouette bar two eyes and a wide smile that plays off racist caricature. It’s taken 40 years, but now Marshall’s influence can be felt globally, with Black figuration a dominant genre of current times. Consequently Marshall’s work can be found at any given time in a group show acknowledging Black artmaking: this year there was Project a Black Planet: The Art and Culture of Panafrica at Art Institute of Chicago; The Time is Always Now: Artists Reframe the Black Figure [https://artreview.com/the-time-is-always-now-artists-reframe-the-black-figure-national-portrait-gallery-london-review/] at National Portrait Gallery, London (travelling to The Box, Plymouth; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and the North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh); and Entangled Pasts, 1768–now: Art, Colonialism and Change at the Royal Academy, London (at which he showed Scipio Moorhead, Portrait of Himself, 1776, 2007, a refiguring of the eponymous, enslaved African-American artist into art history). Marshall’s participation in this last is a prelude to a solo exhibition at the institution next year.",

            "First impressions matter, so it made sense that Parreno was tapped to work on the lobby of the revamped MoMA this year. There he installed a marquee in which rows of lightbulbs glow from a triangular frame. On venturing further into the New York museum, the Frenchman’s typically disconcerting installation continues with approximately 120 moving lamps. Parreno has long been interested in questions of interaction, and another gig this year was at Espace Louis Vuitton in Venice: a show that featured a computer programme which activated, in sequence, a marquee, a mechanical mirrored shutter and phosphorescent wallpaper. The marquee is a sculptural form he’s returned to since 2006, inspired by the luminous signs that welcomed punters to American cinemas in the 1950s. So it should be no surprise that Parreno’s second feature film, titled No More Reality Whatsoever, which premiered at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February, was described by its maker as a ‘film of films, a seance of cinema’.",

Walker’s European touring show A Black Hole is Everything a Star Longs to Be closed its second stop, at Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt, in January, before opening for Dutch audiences at the De Pont Museum in Tilburg, in July. Australians also got a taste of Walker’s practice, with a show at the National Art Gallery, Canberra, while a survey of her drawings opened at Sprüth Magers, London, in the summer. Although her vast drawings, cutout black paper silhouettes and monumental sculpture ostensibly concentrate on the history of North American race relations and the traumas and resilience of African Americans (and are shown widely across the US, appearing in over 24 group shows this year alone), her influence can be felt beyond her home country, teasing out moments of the Black experience with subtle ease – not least in her recent turn in the Afrofuturism-themed In the Black Fantastic [https://artreview.com/the-past-and-future-of-afrofuturism/] at London’s Hayward Gallery.",

            "Tate, where Balshaw is director, feels, like museums globally, an increasingly fragile institution, its monolithic authority battered by culture wars and funding constraints (though Balshaw told The Guardian this year, ‘That’s a normal part of life as a museum director’). Where the former used to be the purview of rightwing commentators (The Telegraph’s recent frothing at the museum spending £21,000 ‘on discarded avocado trays’, namely Veronica Ryan’s Arrangement In Layers, Stacking Up Moments I–X, 2016–19, felt like a throwback), Balshaw now must keep an eye out for any controversy that might blow up around the perceived ethics of private funders and sponsors (she’s not averse to making the point herself, using her new book, Gathering of Strangers: Why Museums Matter [https://artreview.com/the-unfortunate-ironies-of-maria-balshaws-gathering-of-strangers/], to criticise the British Museum for taking money from BP). Tate Modern had shows of work by Mike Kelley [https://artreview.com/remaking-mike-kelley-tate-modern-martin-herbert/] and Yoko Ono [https://artreview.com/yoko-ono-music-of-the-mind-tate-modern-review/], while Zanele Muholi returned just three years after their major survey to show new works; Alvaro Barrington received the Tate Britain commission; and Sámi artist Outi Pieski showed at Tate St Ives. Tate Liverpool [https://artreview.com/tate-liverpool-to-close-for-over-a-year/] remained closed for a refurbishment.",

            "This year’s retrospective of Jonas’s work at Tate Modern offered belated recognition of the veteran artist’s influence and a reminder, in the premiere of a new performance, that she has no intention of letting up. Jonas’s heroic status among a younger generation of artists preoccupied by ecological disaster, body politics and interspecies communication has only recently been matched by an elevation to superstardom. Which has good and bad sides: in June, she was announced as the winner of the 2018 Kyoto Prize, worth roughly $900,000; in August, Munich’s Haus der Kunst announced that a budget shortfall meant that her Tate show would not travel to Germany. If it seems odd that an artist who for so long made and exhibited work on the margins should now outstrip the resources of a major institution, then a show at Amanda Wilkinson, London, confirmed that Jonas’s best work is still raw, rickety and intimate. ",

The curator has long been regarded as a conduit to the South American art scene – he is the Guggenheim’s curator-at-large for Latin America and is courted for his inside knowledge by third parties (including Rolls-Royce, who tapped him up to nominate an artist for their ‘Muse’ commissioning programme). This year he’s been focusing on Central American and Caribbean art: notably by cofounding, from the ashes of the Davidoff Art Initiative, the nonprofit Caribbean Art Initiative to support artistic exchanges and cultural programmes in the region. In September, meanwhile, Federico Herrera covered the interior walls of León de la Barra’s Oscar Niemeyer-designed institution with his colourful murals.",

Her list is not (yet) well stocked with artists from the region, so Irish painter Genieve Figgis and James Turrell took the next slots in the programme. Back west, the fruits of a trip Miquel Barceló made through West Africa during the 1980s were shown in Brussels, Farah Atassi made her gallery debut in New York and Rech staged the first Jannis Kounellis show in the UK since the artist’s death, a tie-in to the retrospective Germano Celant curated at Fondazione Prada in Venice. The floating city also hosted a Förg exhibition in time for the Biennale, at which Rech’s stable was represented by Ryoji Ikeda and George Condo.",

Liu put the annual loss at the West Bund outpost of his Long Museum (one of two in Shanghai, curated by his wife Wang Wei) at a cool $6m. Relatively nothing then. The private museum continues to display works from the couple’s extensive holdings – numbering over 2,000 works – of traditional and contemporary Chinese and international art.

Mousse magazine even cited her when announcing its redesign this year. Though it has been a quiet year for publishing, with limited public speaking beyond her professor emerita role at the History of Consciousness department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, it’s understandable why she remains such a touchstone: her writing addresses so many of our current issues, from the environment, to gender and queer identity, to AI and tech. Haraway’s thinking is nothing if not intersectional: regarding her papal citation, coming despite her long history of criticising the Catholic Church, she quipped, ‘Some baby Jesuit who’s into animal studies and science studies and feminist theory for some weird reason has been reading me’. They’re not alone.",

            "By spearheading the international positioning of a group of Kukje Gallery’s artists, including Ha Chong-Hyun, Lee Ufan and Park Seo-Bo, Lee turned the Dansaekhwa movement into an art historical period that could be digested by foreign audiences. Lee’s approach, which has focused on organising prominent international exhibitions, including collateral shows at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], made their name – as well as her own. Now that Seoul has become a major node in the art market, Lee, whose gallery was founded in 1982 and represents approximately 50 artists, including Haegue Yang and the newly signed eighty-nine-year-old sculptor Kim Yun Shin (featured in this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/]), is more ambivalent about how helpful artworld hype can be. ‘I think we should not be “too excited” about the Korean art scene being globally recognized, becoming another art hub in Asia… Both galleries and artists should stay on their toes,’ she warned The Korea Herald. Now a family affair, with Lee’s children involved, Kukje is no doubt in it for the long haul.",

Yet for all the solemnity of its historical themes, Kentridge is an artist with market clout to match his impressive institutional record. A survey of his work was held at the Kunstmuseum Basel during the prestigious slot coinciding with the city’s art fair, a precursor to a double-whammy institutional outing that opened this summer in Cape Town: a show at the Norval Foundation focuses on Kentridge’s sculpture from 1984, while Zeitz MOCAA is exhibiting his drawings, printmaking, films and tapestries. A show, as curator Azu Nwagbogu succinctly puts it, both ‘humongous and momentous’. To top that, the artist landed Japan’s Praemium Imperiale in September, with its 15 million yen honorarium.",

Also in 2024: the inaugural K11 Artist Prize, designed to support emerging Asian artists and spearheaded by the foundation’s International Council, featuring prominent collectors Sarah Arison and Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo [https://artreview.com/artist/patrizia-sandretto-re-rebaudengo/], and cultural strategist Alia Al-Senussi among its members. Cheng said his resignation permits him more time for public service, which includes chairing the Hong Kong government’s Mega Arts and Cultural Events Committee, responsible for providing incentives to major international events (such as Art Basel’s HK edition), and the various museum boards he attends, including New York’s MoMA PS1 and the Met, Paris’s Centre Pompidou and London’s Tate and Royal Academy of Arts.",

With its rakish reputation, the gallery was always going to be at home in the Marais in Paris, where it opened a fourth official space in October with a group show that typically mixed Brazilian and international names. ‘Official’ because the restless trio don’t tend to contain themselves solely to their addresses in São Paulo (a warehouse mothership), Brussels (opened in 2017) and their New York TriBeCa gallery. They spent their summer staging a group show at a seventeenth-century church in the bucolic Dutch coastal village of Retranchement, with a large group show of works on paper by artists including Michael Dean and Mariana Castillo Deball; while a show by painter Marina Perez Simão was the fourth to be staged at Villa Era, a nineteenth-century estate in the Italian countryside. Now they’ve refurbished a property in Upstate New York for residencies, starting with Paulo Nazareth and Paulo Monteiro.",

As the director of Cape Town’s Zeitz MOCAA since 2019, and having established her name through the RAW Material Company in Senegal, Kouoh has become a leading light at home and abroad. Current shows at the institution include solos for Ghanaian-American artist Rita Mawuena Benissan [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-november-2024/#:~:text=Rita%20Mawuena%20Benissan] and South African Nolan Oswald Dennis. Earlier this year, Kunstmuseum Basel opened When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting [https://artreview.com/a-century-of-black-figuration-in-painting-review/], a survey exhibition curated by Kouoh that debuted at Zeitz. Not that it has all been plain sailing: in June, the artist Tracey Rose lambasted Kouoh and Kunstmuseum Bern, claiming that a work about Palestine had been censored [https://artreview.com/kunstmuseum-bern-hosting-tracey-rose-retrospective-branded-despicable-by-artist/] in her solo show at the Swiss institution, curated by Kouoh. Earlier this year, Kouoh oversaw Zeitz MOCAA’s annual gala, the proceeds of which help fund its educational and curatorial programming.",

            "‘Maybe the human thing is over,’ posited the artist Julia Scher on restaging her 1998 installation Wonderland at Esther Schipper’s Berlin gallery in December. That work is a prescient take on the power of tech, and Schipper’s taste chimes with our increasing awareness of technological and ecological crisis. She works with Hito Steyerl (whose Serpentine Gallery show this year focused on AI), Pierre Huyghe (curator of an Okayama Art Summit that foregrounded nonhuman intelligences), Philippe Parreno (who created an ‘autopoetic automaton’ for the refurbished MoMA, New York), Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster and Tomás Saraceno. Those two collaborated on a show spread across the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza and TBA21 in Madrid this year that, its curator claimed, posed ‘questions surrounding technologies, artificial intelligence, the collective minds of animals, and the power and attraction of the unknown’. If the future is posthuman, then Schipper has it covered.",

At the end of last year she opened Japanorama at the Pompidou Metz, exploring the country’s artistic production from the postwar era to the present and centred around her favoured theme: the posthuman body. That was followed by a retrospective exhibition of iconic 1980s avantgardists Dumb Type at the same institution. And Hasegawa continued to make France a mini-Japan in July, with Fukami, a show exploring Japanese aesthetics via traditional and contemporary works of art at Paris’s Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild. ‘You could call my perspective post avantgarde to the extent that I highlight artists who developed their practices at a distance from Western influence,’ Hasegawa told Numéro magazine at the time. That’s not to say that she’s avoiding Western influences, however, as a solo exhibition of work by Francis Alÿs, curated at Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum in November, will surely prove.",

Gallery artist Cao Fei this summer became the first Chinese artist to have a solo show at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, while Vitamin’s commitment to finding new ways of living as much as selling was reiterated when Hu turned up at Berlin’s Haus der Kulturen der Welt in April to discuss ‘alternative conditions for living together’. Similar sentiments were expressed in Danh Vo’s solo exhibition at the Mirrored Gardens, ‘a space grown out of anything the artist has chanced upon or anything that has found its way to the artist’, and a long-awaited solo show by Chu Yun opened this month.",

There was an established market and the contemporary artists we were working with weren’t part of that,” industrialist Rajeeb told the same audience. Given the considerable number of local and international institutions now affiliating themselves with the Samdanis’ initiative, as well as visitor numbers reaching almost half a million for the sixth edition, in 2023, there is clearly more enthusiasm at this stage. The biennial summit may be skipping a year (the seventh edition will open in 2026), but such momentum has led the couple to envision Srihatta, the 40-hectare art centre and sculpture park they are building in Sylhet, scheduled to open in 2025. There are also various advisory and museum patrons’ committees to keep them busy, including Tate, Alserkal Avenue and Asia Society.\n\n*Last Year 96 (with Diana Campbell [https://artreview.com/artist/nadia-rajeeb-samdani-diana-campbell-betancourt/])",

The artist was an acolyte of LA’s jazz scene when he went to CalArts during the 1960s, and Hammons has also spent his life resisting conventions and improvising his own career trajectory. So it is that an artist who disdains the artworld can show at a blue-chip commercial gallery (installing something akin to a homeless encampment of tents in view of Hauser & Wirth’s snazzy restaurant); how an artist whose most famous work involved selling snowballs on a New York sidewalk is now recreating in skeletal steel a warehouse that once stood on the Hudson River’s Pier 52. That permanent public artwork dedicated to community broke ground this year with one false note: Warren Kanders, the teargas manufacturer who resigned from the board of the Whitney after protests, is among its funders.",

Aside from generating a thriving local arts scene, Tohmé has become an expert at building networks across the Middle East, North Africa and beyond – an invaluable mission in a country struck by ongoing conflict. In addition to its exhibition programme (including a major show of Simone Fattal’s drawings in 2024) and free educational programmes for artists (workshops this year were led by the likes of Haig Aivazian, Marwa Arsanios and Joe Namy), the organisation ran a series of artist-film screenings at Beirut’s Sursock Museum. It was also one of the venues for ‘Why Germany’, an international lecture series reflecting on the recent crackdown on free speech in that country, for which it invited writer and academic Yasmeen Daher to consider the evolution of the Palestine solidarity movement. Tohmé’s skills as a cultural organiser are likely to have played a part in her recent appointment as director of the next Istanbul Biennial [https://artreview.com/christine-tohme-to-curate-18th-istanbul-biennial/].",

The recent Kathy Acker exhibition, in which the writer and feminist icon’s own work was put into dialogue with contemporary artists, is a case in point. It might have split the critics – ArtReview’s writer challenged its ‘hagiography’, The Guardian thought it ‘wild and wonderful’ – but it certainly got people talking. Kalmár has also pursued the ICA’s historic focus on integrating art and life by taking the postshow wind-down to another level: in March Rirkrit Tiravanija installed a permanent sake bar. But it’s not all about kicking back. ‘We are in a time of crisis,’ Kalmár explained in reference to Brexit and the rise of populism. When, in September, Wolfgang Tillmans was announced as chair of the board, Kalmár stated that ‘these are times for artists to lead’.",

Continua’s Beijing space opened in 2005. This year, while most dealers were chasing collectors to ex-urban resorts of the rich, Continua took a punt on central Paris (as well as a popup for Anish Kapoor in Dubai). ‘There was sadness’ to the shuttered city, Fiaschi told The Art Newspaper. They opened, he added ‘to generate smiles’, first with a JR-curated exhibition pre-refurb, followed by two group shows. Still undergoing renovation is the controversially privatised Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo, where the gallery staged a small show of Cuban artists in anticipation of opening a space within the complex. Also conflicted is the trio’s operation in Cuba, which some Cuban activists have accused of legitimising the government.",

            "That Szymczyk’s staging of Documenta 14 across Athens and Kassel divided opinion might have been expected, given the curator’s promise to challenge preconceptions about what the major exhibition could be. Yet controversy shifted into crisis when it emerged late last year that the organisation had overspent by €7m, leading the Kassel branch of Germany’s far-right AfD party to sue Szymczyk and CEO Annette Kulenkampff for mismanaging public funds (they were cleared in August of any wrongdoing). That the exhibition had been politicised was confirmed in October by the removal of Olu Oguibe’s Monument to Strangers and Refugees (2017) from Kassel’s central square by the local government. Szymczyk might have been guilty of overreach, but his radical decentring of the quinquennial – twinned exhibitions complemented by expansive publishing and public programmes exploring indigeneity, antifascism, resistance, identity and marginality – provoked conversations that feel increasingly pressing. Not to mention that his recent travails reveal the upped stakes in the European culture wars. His next move is attended with interest.",

Its four spaces in Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore were closed for months due to public health restrictions. Headquartered in Shanghai, the gallery came out of hibernation ready to dominate the city’s art scene during the last quarter of 2020, with its A-listers getting an impressive airing. Xue Song showed at Powerlong Museum, Yang Zhenzhong at Rén Space, Zhang Enli at Power Station of Art, Zhu Jia at Modern Art Base and Yang Fudong at HOW Art Museum – all in the same month! But Shanghart is not all about the Chinese-Male-Artist-of-a-Certain-Age. At its own M50 space is Under the Sign of Saturn, a group show featuring three young female artists from Guangzhou – Qin Jin, Chen Dandizi and Lin Yuqi – demonstrating its commitment to supporting new voices from outside the typical centres of art production.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

May You Live in Interesting Times was too Western-centric for some – almost a third of the artists were based in the US – but the overall critical consensus was a pretty solid ‘B’. ‘Intermittent bursts of urgency and the occasional surprise’ was the verdict of Adrian Searle in The Guardian, while Jason Farago admired the artist list in The New York Times but felt that Rugoff had nonetheless played it ‘safe’. Meanwhile, Zoé Whitley joined Rugoff’s Hayward Gallery from the Tate (and fresh off curating the British Pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale). Whatever the critics thought of Venice, Rugo can count on one fan: in June, he was awarded an OBE by the Queen.",

As controversy over a slated Brussels outpost rumbles on (in Belgium’s domestic politics, at least), the museum’s temporary project space in Málaga has been extended by five years. Back in France, the museum announced a 22,000sqm ‘art factory’ in the city’s suburbs while in February the museum’s original foray outside the fourth arrondissement, the Centre Pompidou-Metz, staged a Lee Ufan show.

And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

As the former member of the Italian Communist Party told Vogue this year, family takes up another third, while the rest of her time is devoted to ‘culture and the Fondazione’. The Venice-and-Milan-based private institution is no trinket (with Tokyo and Shanghai project spaces), and Prada is very hands-on, telling Vogue how she struggled to find a curator who would fully embrace her vision of a future show on feminism. She did, however, get the likes of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler to curate Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Technology and Power, 1500–2025, a Marx-tinged show on tech and power that closed in January; while Meriem Bennani installed a solo exhibition in Milan, Christoph Büchel [https://artreview.com/christoph-buchel-monte-di-pieta-fondazione-prada-venice-biennale/] in Venice, Michaël Borremans in China and Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin in Japan.",

This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration – something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Last year Sandretto Re Rebaudengo was named president of Fondazione Arte CRT, which supplies loans and new work to the Turin Civic Gallery (GAM) and Castello di Rivoli, as well as site-specific commissions for OGR Torino, and has since doubled the foundation’s annual acquisitions budget to €1m. The patron, whose Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo has amassed a collection of more than 1,500 artworks, has long had exhibition spaces in Turin and neighbouring Guarene, but in recent years she’s been expanding her reach: she’s turning a Venetian island into an art centre (set to open next year), and the Madrid wing of the Fondazione is now homing in on a permanent HQ. Sandretto also sits on committees at New York’s MoMA, New Museum and CCS Bard, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, London’s Tate Modern, Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum and Barcelona’s Fundación MACBA, among others. At her eponymous Turin foundation meanwhile, she gave solo shows to The Otolith Group, Stefanie Heinze and Bekhbaatar Enkhtur.",

The UK-born artist, critic and curator took over at New York’s White Columns in 2004, bringing to it (and New York) his intuitive grasp of how art can mix pop culture, subculture and every culture that doesn’t count as lifelessly institutional. So while he’s plugged in and sought after (he’s founding curatorial adviser to New York’s Independent art fair, and could place a curated section based on the life of legendary dealer Hudson at Frieze New York in May), his appreciation of the maverick reaches far from artworld epicentres – with painter Peter Doig, Higgs organised a show of the overlooked Grenada-born British painter Denzil Forrester, in the artist’s home of Cornwall. White Columns, meanwhile, ranges widely (having moved to bigger premises in April) – from a show about punk icon Richard Hell to shows by artists who live with mental illness and disability. ",

The advancement added another asset to his portfolio: the STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery. Three months later, a partnership deal was announced between NGS, where 70 percent of the collection is dedicated to Singaporean artists and 30 percent to Southeast Asian artists, and the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts to encourage loans, research partnerships and residency programmes. The 2024 exhibitions programme at NGS featured a retrospective of Kim Lim and shows for Cheong Soo Pieng, pioneer of the Nanyang art style, and centenarian Lim Tze Peng, Singapore’s oldest living and active artist. Meanwhile, Pratchaya Phinthong and Yee I-Lann received shows at SAM which also supported the organisation of Robert Zhao Renhui’s Singaporean Pavilion [https://artreview.com/robert-zhao-renhui-on-representing-singapore-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] (NGS also made a substantial loan of eight works to the Biennale’s International Pavilion [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/], curated by Adriano Pedrosa [https://artreview.com/artist/adriano-pedrosa/?year=2024]).",

Postponing the exhibition, curated by Defne Ayas and Natasha Ginwala, to February 2021 means organisers will miss the 40-year anniversary of the Gwangju Uprising, the brutally suppressed democracy protests the event memorialises. Symbolism is important for Kim, evident not least in her Real DMZ project, which has seen art placed within the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea and its border area since 2012. A work by Soyoung Chung, presented in collaboration with the Real DMZ’s Negotiating Borders 2, had an afterlife at the Curitiba Biennial, which closed in February. Kim got a show by Belgian artist Francis Alÿs up and running at Tai Kwun Contemporary, Hong Kong, and took the reins (with SooJin Lee) of a huge Lee Bul retrospective, Utopia Saved, at St Petersburg’s Manege Central Exhibition Hall.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

While HKW was closed at the start of the year, they continued much of their programme, such as the ongoing thread The New Alphabet, exploring alternative forms of learning, online. From the summer, the two-year project Investigative Commons was launched, following on a long collaboration with Forensic Architecture, exploring how we might re-establish notions of public truth, while the exhibition and publication Illiberal Arts addressed the inequities at the heart of liberal capitalism. The multistrand, fast-paced programme has continued with the oral history project Archive of Refuge, turning to the memories of people who migrated to Germany over the past 70 years, and working towards the conference series The White West: Whose Universal? next year. Alongside the institution’s director Bernd Scherer, Franke continues to push at the idea of what a contemporary institution can be.",

Curated by the gallerist and Francesco Bonami, the exhibition, like the architecture housing it, sought to ‘fuse elements of historicism with modernity’. Yan was the subject of a solo show at De Carlo’s second Milanese gallery in September, while fellow painter Jamian Juliano-Villani (pictures of Amy Winehouse, goats wearing Ugg boots, a dog waving a knife), took over the London space over the summer. She was followed by the more minimal, abstract canvases of McArthur Binion (who also exhibited, earlier this year, in De Carlo’s Hong Kong gallery), described by the Financial Times as ‘some of the finest and most thoughtprovoking contemporary paintings to be seen in Europe right now’.",

            "As countries in Asia look to establish and substantiate their own art histories independently from Western narratives, the Asia Art Archive in Hong Kong performs a lowkey but indispensable role in collecting and sharing information. This vital resource for scholars and art historians, cofounded 19 years ago by Claire Hsu, now has over 80,000 records in its collections, stretching from exhibition catalogues and materials to artist’s personal archives. But it’s not all about art history for the nonprofit organisation, which also responds to the times and looks to set the agenda through talks, residencies and research that complement its ever-expanding library. In March, for example, it held an exhibition of the late Singaporean performance artist Lee Wen’s sketchbooks and plans to celebrate its 20th anniversary next year with a busy programme. One highlight of which is a collaboration with Jakarta-based educational project Gudskul for Art Basel Hong Kong.",

It is not just the high profile at home that marks out the gallery, but the global network that its geographically-diverse artist roster has firmly infiltrated. Wilfredo Prieto represented Cuba at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], while WangShui, Bárbara Sánchez-Kane [https://artreview.com/barbara-sanchez-kane-new-lexicons-for-embodiment-kurimanzutto-new-york-review/] and Ana Segovia were in the main show; Haegue Yang [https://artreview.com/artist/haegue-yang/] showed in London and Chicago; Minerva Cuevas exhibited at CC Foundation, Shanghai; and the gallery worked with peers Shibunkaku for a presentation at Art Collaborations Kyoto. Kurimanzutto’s satellite space in New York gives them clout there, too: this year, the Met installed specially commissioned architectural interventions by Nairy Baghramian and Petrit Halilaj, and in February the gallery announced the representation of the estate of the late New York icon John Giorno.",

This year marks 20 years since they moved to their Mitte headquarters, and 25 since they began working with Jorge Pardo, an anniversary celebrated by a recent show. Elsewhere in the programme were thoughtful group shows on negation and the construction of selfhood, a loopily cerebral Mario García Torres exhibition involving an animatronic tortoise and performances by Austrian screen legend Helmut Berger, a stormily politicised James Benning presentation and, demonstrating that Neuger and Riemschneider won’t be pinned down, a display of paintings by Billy Childish.  ",

He celebrated – how else? – with a show of Beuys’s works on paper at his London gallery at the start of the year, and another at Ropac’s Seoul branch at the end of the year. Having opened in Salzburg in 1983, and adding two London and two Paris spaces along the way, Ropac landed in South Korea in 2021 and this year doubled the square meterage there by adding another floor, allowing for a simultaneous exhibition of Donald Judd’s sculptures and paintings in September. As well as some of the great American estates, Ropac has become the de facto rep for canonical artists of the German-speaking world, among them VALIE EXPORT, Anselm Kiefer, Not Vital and Imi Knoebel. Georg Baselitz turned eighty-five this year, so there were more celebrations to arrange, with shows staged by the painter at nine institutions around the world, including at London’s Serpentine galleries and Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich.",

            "American artist Rashid Johnson and Russian collector Dasha Zhukova were the unlikely bedfellows to be jointly honoured at Performa’s annual gala this year. Picking up the bill to the glam event – a fundraiser for the long-running New York performance biennial – was Chang, the founder of the Beijing-based Domus Collection (and collector of Johnson’s work). Live art is an expensive business, with little in the way of a market to help it along, and Chang, as president of Performa’s board, has been a major backer. Yet it’s not just cutting-edge work that attracts Chang: he’s a (heavily involved) trustee at the Royal Academy in London, as well as vice chair of the International Council at Tate. Of course this is just the public face of Chang’s patronage. As an avid collector, he is searching out, he once told ArtReview, works that have ‘truth and beauty’; when Chang favours an artist, he becomes a supporter in more ways than one.",

            "‘There is no discussion of art anymore,’ concluded Steyerl at the close of 2023 when contemplating the artworld in Germany. ‘It’s Israel–Palestine, and that’s it,’ she told The New York Times. The artist had removed her work from Documenta in 2022 [https://artreview.com/hito-steyerl-says-she-has-no-faith-in-documenta-tackling-antisemitism/] due to what she perceived as inaction by its curators over antisemitism, and was scathing of many of her peers who had publicly criticised Israel, telling The Guardian that many were merely practising ‘art as social media performance’. Furthermore, she bemoaned that it was those who only condemn violence on one side ‘that dominate the debate’. Steyerl’s engagement with the conflict comes as no surprise: questions of power, violence and mediation have been her subject matter for two decades now, parlayed into her video essays and multimedia installations. This year she premiered three new works that take the Nord Stream oil pipeline system as their subject at the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, and settled into her new role as professor in Emergent Digital Media at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.",

For her show at David Zwirner, which opens in November and features a new Infinity Mirrored Room, they’re expecting 100,000 people, lines around the block and – of course – one hell of a presence on Instagram. Kusama’s polka dots, pumpkins, polished metal balls and mirrors are the I-was-there backdrops of our time, regardless of their standalone quality. In this regard, Kusama is a hugely important figure in the artworld’s transitioning and ballooning into – well, whatever it’s turning into, underwritten by social media and FOMO. The guaranteed turnstile action means she’s a huge draw with museums – and she’s had her own in Tokyo since 2017 – though there’s also an undervoiced case for her art speaking to the revival of interest in psychedelic experiences. What’s unarguable is the gratifying irony that the artworld’s hottest ticket is for shows by a pumpkin-obsessed ninety-year-old woman.\n\n",

Which is good, because what with Brazil’s political situation and the fact that a third edition of her boutique art fair did not materialise this year, she has had a lot to take in her stride. More positively, she had her work cut out with the many museum shows for the artists represented by her São Paulo-based gallery. In September the largest show of Cildo Meireles’s work ever staged in Latin America took over the galleries of Sesc Pompeia, showing the artist at both his most spectacular and subtly political. The six-decade survey of Anna Maria Maiolino’s work at the Whitechapel Gallery in London (complemented by a show back home in Strina’s Jardins space) was similarly comprehensive. Leonor Antunes, another of her artists to have a stellar year, represented Portugal at the Venice Biennale and won the Zurich Art Prize 2019.",

The cool middle-aged people were represented there, too: an exhibition of Michael Krebber’s austere works in May ‘still managed to piss people off’, reported Artforum. But it was a dead cool person who really stole the limelight in 2019. In the early 1950s, Andy Warhol collaborated with author Ralph Thomas (‘Corkie’) Ward on a series of self-published books. The first of these, A Is an Alphabet, a collection of 26 loose pages that feature Warhol’s cute illustrations and Ward’s weird rhymes – ‘a surreal, horny fairytale’, as Interview succinctly described it – went on show in Berlin before travelling to New York.",

            "Perrotin, who disclosed last year that he would be selling a 60 percent stake [https://artreview.com/perrotin-in-negotiations-with-investment-management-to-sell-majority-stake/] in his gallery business to a French investment company, has announced this year that he will open a new London space inside Claridge’s hotel. This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

For to be the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art involves a lot of fundraising and a head for figures. These are likely prefixed by dollar signs and suffixed by ‘million’: the $650m needed to complete LACMA’s teardown-and-rebuild capital project; the $117.5m Govan secured from LA County in April. Or they might refer to missing square metres, after it emerged that Peter Zumthor’s design will include 10 percent less area than the planned 36,000sqm. Or be attached to the deal with Budi Tek’s Yuz Museum, with which LACMA will partner on a jointly owned foundation managing 90 percent of the Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur’s collection. Govan knows that making art accessible in California requires an unholy alliance of number crunching and celebrity: hence roping in Kanye West to donate $10m to James Turrell’s decades-awaited Roden Crater.",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

            "Artist, curator, institutional director – Al Qasimi can claim to belong to nearly every constituent sector of the artworld (albeit these days she’s not really that well known for her painting). Plus, in the real world, she’s royalty. And yet, in recent years she has leveraged her expertise and knowledge of art from the Gulf region and further afield, to operate in geographies beyond the Emirate and areas in which she can absolutely rely on royal privilege. An exhibition of paintings she curated by the senior Māori artist Emily Karaka, which opened this autumn at the Sharjah Art Foundation, of which she is also president and founding director, may be indicative of the direction planned for the 2026 Biennale of Sydney [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-lead-the-2026-biennale-of-sydney/]. Al Qasimi was this year appointed curator of the Australian survey, which she will work on while developing her plans for the 2025 Aichi Triennale [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-direct-aichi-triennale-2025/] in Japan, of which she is artistic director (the first non-Japanese person to occupy the position, although she speaks the language, having studied there). Having previously curated the Lahore Biennale (in 2020) and the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Al Qasimi is in demand, and her global presence is reflected in her home institution’s programming, which, in addition to Karaka, has featured survey exhibitions of South African multimedia icon William Kentridge, Brazilian painter Antonio Dias and Pakistani artist and Women’s Action Forum cofounder Lala Rukh, not to mention the annual March Meeting [https://artreview.com/the-top-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-march-2024/#:~:text=March%20Meeting%202024%3A%20Tawashujat] conference. Next February marks the opening of the 16th Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/] (Al Qasimi curated the 2023 edition [https://artreview.com/artists-for-2023-sharjah-biennial-revealed/], developing a programme initiated by the late Okwui Enwezor, having been involved with the event – as director – since 2003, when she cocurated the sixth edition). For this edition, Al Qasimi has appointed an all-female team of curators [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] that includes many of the leading lights among curators operating in the context of the global majority, including Sri Lanka’s Natasha Ginwala [https://artreview.com/artist/natasha-ginwala/], Indonesian curator Alia Swastika [https://artreview.com/artist/alia-swastika/?year=2024], Bahraini-Singaporean artist Amal Khalaf, New Zealand artist Megan Tamati-Quennell and Turkish curator Zeynep Öz. Moreover, in the context of an artworld in which cancellations and boycotts are rife – coming from every direction – and generating a consequent culture of fear, Al Qasimi remains one of the few voices still prepared to use the platform art (and royal privilege) affords them in order to express their opinions directly and to keep discussions that most people allow to fade away firmly in the spotlight, whether they concern the current carnage in Palestine and Lebanon or those suffering from other conflicts across the globe. Beyond all that, Al Qasimi also serves as president of the International Biennale Association, president of the hugely influential Africa Institute in Sharjah and on the board of Ashkal Alwan in Beirut. She is also on the advisory boards of the Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi and Darat al Funun in Amman. Beyond her involvement with art, she also founded the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, and earlier this year presented a clothing collection in London which was developed from the work of her late brother, who worked in the fashion industry. But beyond her personal achievements, Al Qasimi is also a symbol of the increasing influence of the Gulf region in the spheres of finance, commerce, politics, sports and entertainment, and, of course (but perhaps primarily by virtue of the first two elements on this list) art.",

The buzzing beasties added to the sense of claustrophobia generated by standing led screens showing layered, flicking, nightmarish images derived by running data from MRI brain scans through neural imaging networks. Yet Huyghe’s joining of the dots between man, machine and nature has never been comfortable, as the residents of Okayama are now finding. As director of that city’s second art summit, Huyghe has roped in 17 (Western) artists and collectives including Matthew Barney and Lili Reynaud-Dewar to create an exhibition as ‘living entity’ through which to ‘navigate heterogeneous things, chemical and algorithmic processes, as well as different intelligent life forms’. If this sounds natural for an artist long associated with Relational Aesthetics, it makes sense that the man who coined the term, Nicolas Bourriaud, included Huyghe’s work in the group show inaugurating the curator’s Contemporary Art Center of Montpellier.",

Organised chronologically and installed, as always, by the artist and his team (over 16 days and nights, he says), it provided an easy image of the photographer’s journey from nightclub imagery to a more wide-ranging experimentation in representing the world around him (and beyond: astronomy is a passion). Meanwhile, Fragile, a show touring African cities over the past five years, arrived at its final stop across two venues in Lagos; his solo at Mumok, Vienna, closed after an extended run in August. And then Tillmans was back in London for a round of fundraising on behalf of the ICA, where he has been chair since 2019. Demonstrating that his penchant for hedonism isn’t over, Tillmans outlined plans to make the art institution party central, including a licence to serve alcohol until 6am.",

Times change, but Gillick keeps his eye trained on the intersection of aesthetics and capital, as he has done for the past two decades. While his output ranges from architectural installation to sculpture, his videoworks took centre stage at the Madre Museum in Naples this summer. If his work affects the corporate aesthetic – his exhibition at Maureen Paley, London, in September consisted of slick architectural interventions and more films – then visitors to Kunsthalle Wien in July would have been reassured that Gillick puts his heart and soul into his work, as they witnessed the production of a feature film he is making with Austrian collective Gelitin. He is equally influential behind closed doors, sitting on the steering committee of Maja Hoffmann’s Luma Foundation. With such consistent success, Gillick’s blue Mondays should be few and far between.",

His sculpture was the focal point of a survey that opened in May at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, materially derived from dilapidated architecture and the urban realm, and specifically informed by Freedmen’s Town in Houston’s Fourth Ward. With regards to the latter, Gates is advising an initiative that plans to preserve this historic neighbourhood built and shaped by Black people following emancipation: an endeavour that’s in the mould of the socially engaged mini-empire he has been building on the South Side of Chicago since 2006. Over in Tokyo, the artist’s Afro-Mingei exhibition at the Mori Art Museum, which imagined ‘the artistic possibilities of combining Black aesthetics and Japanese craft philosophies to envision hybrid-culture futures’, laid the groundwork for incense and sake collaborations with small family-owned businesses in Japan. This mix of commerce and creativity made him an obvious choice for Prada’s diversity council, where Gates has spearheaded a mentorship programme for designers of colour.",

That loss is not always a bad thing was perhaps the message of Brian Belott, the self-proclaimed ‘Master of Discard’, who closed the gallery with his thrift-store assemblages. Nor is Brown likely to mope: he had four artists in the international exhibition at the Venice Biennale – Ed Atkins, Frida Orupabo, Avery Singer and Golden Lion winner Arthur Jafa – with Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys representing Belgium. There were also shows for Alex Katz and Ella Kruglyanskaya in his Harlem space and Charlemagne Palestine and Laura Owens at his Rome outpost, while Karl Holmqvist joined the restaurant/gallery that Brown and Rirkrit Tiravanija run in upstate New York. This autumn there was a trip to Paris to stage a show at Galerie Patrick Seguin.",

Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

As chairman and CEO of luxury group LVMH, a little bit of his Bloomberg-estimated $97.3bn fortune goes to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. This year the private museum gave over its galleries to Gilbert & George, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Courtauld’s hallowed collection of Impressionism. The foundation’s smaller ‘espaces’ in Venice and Tokyo, meanwhile, hosted shows by Philippe Parreno and Christian Boltanski respectively. Yet it was an even more spectacular brand of philanthropy that put Arnault and his family in the spotlight this year, after they publicly announced a €200m donation to Notre-Dame while the cathedral was still smouldering (conveniently overshadowing the €100m earlier pledged by his nemesis François Pinault). Sceptics suggested that Arnault would benefit from a tax break (he says not), and sniping over this and other megadonations was only partially quelled when, in September, they were eventually signed off.",

This last was Robert Colescott, whose paintings, which Blum & Poe hung at their Los Angeles gallery in March, combined surrealism with satire to comment on the state of race politics. Also joining the gallery was young West Coaster Mimi Lauter, who had a show in May, Chicago-based Tony Lewis, Brazilian Solange Pessoa and Japan’s Tomoo Gokita. The gallery has had a presence in Gokita’s hometown of Tokyo since 2014, and it was there, in June, that it showed Agnès Varda. The New Wave filmmaker is undergoing something of a renaissance (and, in collaborations with JR, being embraced by the artworld). That the boys are championing an older artist proves something of a theme: they also gave octogenarian sculptor Wendell Dayton his first major solo show.",

Their private museum, The Broad, in downtown Los Angeles, is one of the most important such institutions in the US, and while the couple have not historically been so adventurous in the nature of their acquisitions, they make up for this conservatism in sheer dollar spend. Their holdings include works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jasper Johns, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama and Andy Warhol, and they estimate they’ve made 8,500 loans to over 500 institutions around the world in their lifetimes. This year The Broad was bolder, making a statement by staging a new retrospective of Shirin Neshat. While highly decorated, the Iranian artist has never had a show on such a scale – opening in October, this vast survey includes approximately 230 photographs and eight videoworks – so the Broads can be credited with offering a corrective.",

This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

Her holdings, concentrating on art from Latin America, are constantly on loan, as well as increasingly being gifted directly to institutions. For example, the Reina Sofía in Madrid was given 45 works by 33 artists (all made since 1990) in March from the Phelps de Cisneros collection, a bequest that followed another donation of 202 works in January to Reína Sofia, MoMA and five other international museums. Hers is a name worth remembering for independent curators and scholars, too: Phelps de Cisneros is the purse behind various residencies and research fellowships, including the Independent Curators International’s annual travel grant.",

He will be its third director in eight years when he takes up the position in 2019. Biesenbach is not the stereotypical ‘safe pair of hands’, but while some of his exhibitions in New York have failed to garner critical acclaim, this is countered by lauded shows such as this year’s Cathy Wilkes solo at PS1, and his habit of championing artists the rest of us are yet to cotton on to. And there is no doubt he has the skills to steady the ship. Biesenbach knows that where he goes, attention is paid. The only blip this year came with a lawsuit issued by curator Nikki Columbus alleging that MoMA PS1 had offered her a curatorial position, only to rescind the offer when it found out that she was pregnant.",

            "This year has been business as usual for the founder of White Cube, who focused on consolidating a growing empire following the opening of two new spaces, in Seoul and New York, last year (joining ones in London, Hong Kong and Paris). Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

She ‘drafts’ shows like a draughtswoman, she says; ‘you curate pork to make prosciutto’. Either way, there was no filler this year at Turin’s Castello di Rivoli, of which she is director, and Cerruti Villa, which put its $600m collection of modern art on display for the first time. The former hosted exhibitions by artist Michael Rakowitz and Anri Sala. Yet the bulk of Christov-Bakargiev’s energy has this year been devoted to preparing the Cerruti collection – amassed by entrepreneur Francesco Federico Cerruti from the late 1960s to 2014 – for its big public reveal in April. Through a body of work ranging from Francisco de Goya’s The Disasters of War (1863) to Medardo Rosso’s The Jewish Child (1892), as well as more recent paintings by Francis Bacon, Alberto Burri and Pablo Picasso, the collection didn’t need much hyping.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

At the end of 2018, the forthcoming Whitney Biennial – at the museum he’s directed since 2003 – became a flashpoint for controversy when employees demanded the removal of board member Warren B. Kanders over his involvement with teargas manufacturer Safariland. This after the 2017 biennial had been embroiled in a war of words over its inclusion of a painting accused of sensationalising racist violence. This time around, Weinberg dithered, artists quit the biennial and Kanders eventually resigned. One sensed damage-control when, in September, the institution broke ground on David Hammons’s monumental public project Day’s End and Weinberg described the installation as representing ‘our commitment to community and civic good’. Meanwhile, the Whitney continued to settle into its downtown home, with a big Warhol retrospective and an emphasis on shows for artists of colour (Pope.L, Kevin Beasley, Derek Fordjour). How much reputational damage the biennial hullabaloo has caused in the long term remains to be seen.",

            "MCH, the parent company of Spiegler’s Art Basel, might be scaling back on its financial commitments to other ventures, but it remains committed to the main attraction. While MCH has divested its stakes in art fairs in India and Singapore, the Art Basel brand continued to move beyond its core offerings – fairs in Basel, Hong Kong and Miami – by announcing a three-day event in partnership with Abu Dhabi. While details remain sketchy (as they did for Art Basel’s 2018 foray into Buenos Aires, in a consultancy detail it extended this year), ‘highly immersive’ installations are promised, open to the public. Spiegler was seen padding around the booths of Frieze London, shoring up gallery commitment to Art Basel Hong Kong amid the ongoing unrest. Meanwhile, this year’s Art Basel Miami will be the second of the brand’s events to roll out sliding exhibitor fees, a move pioneered last year in Basel to support the participation of smaller galleries.",

She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

(Her 2010 MoMA show was the most popular in the institution’s history, with 850,000 visitors, a number not quite matched by this year’s solos at Bundeskunsthalle, Bonn; Palazzo Strozzi, Florence; Sean Kelly, New York; and Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna, but boons for those spaces nonetheless.) Well get in the queue, because the performance artist’s exhibition schedule is booked to 2024. Abramović is famous enough to be lampooned by Cate Blanchett in a forthcoming Netflix comedy (‘Waiting for the Artist’, an episode of the Documentary Now! series screening next year) and attacked by an artist (a man smashed a portrait of Abramović over the artist’s head in September). Nor does the artist need to be present to make herself felt: the Marina Abramović Institute is increasingly active, staging, for example, eight performances by artists using her ‘method’ at this year’s Bangkok Art Biennale.",

A serial biennial curator, who also hops nimbly between the worlds of public institutions and private foundations, Gioni is artistic director of the Beatrice Trussardi Foundation in his native Italy and the curator of Dark Light: Realism in the Age of Post-Truth at the Aïshti Foundation in Beirut, which featured over 200 works from the collection of Tony and Elham Salamé and focused on the changing meanings of figuration in contemporary art. Proving he can also nip between the worlds of fashion and art, in Doha he is the cocurator of the current Valentino show, Forever Valentino, and, earlier this year, the Jeff Koons survey Lost in America.",

Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

            "‘An institution is a learning system’, Obrist told Forbes this year while discussing the ‘Year of AI’ at London’s Serpentine Galleries. Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "It’s not known what the queen thought of Matthew Day Jackson’s exhibition Pathetic Fallacy at Hauser & Wirth Somerset, but it’s testament to the Wirths’ (pictured above with us-based partner Marc Payot) connections that the British monarch paid their rural gallery a visit in March. Their unique selling point is the lifestyle to which they can allow collectors access: the Fife Arms in Aberdeenshire, the couple’s first excursion into hospitality, was recently named The Sunday Times Hotel of the Year 2019. That trend continued with the opening of a gallery in St Moritz last December; a bookshop in Zürich, which doubles as HQ for the gallery’s publishing arm; and the announcement of a new exhibition space with a ‘robust’ education programme and a restaurant in Menorca in 2020. To fill these spaces, the gallery continues to hoover up artists: signings including Ed Clark, Annie Leibovitz, Glenn Ligon, Mika Rottenberg, Nicolas Party and the estate of John Chamberlain upped the firepower this year.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
