            "E-flux, the half-commercial, half-academic outfit headed by this trio of artists continues its hybrid mission, acting as a (paid-for) distribution centre for the artworld ’s press releases, a journal (in which Hito Steyerl has published many of her most influential essays), a partner on many a symposium (particularly the site’s architecture offshoot) and, perhaps not quite so successfully, an online forum for debate. This year, the saga of e-flux’s bid to control the .art top-level domain extension took a new turn. Having lost out in the bidding, e-flux has partnered with the new owner, marketing .art to its extensive network. E-flux’s influence ensured that prominent institutions signed up straightaway (including the Stedelijk Museum and Para Site), with e-flux subscribers getting second dibs before the domain extension was put on wider sale. Meanwhile Vidokle, Aranda and Kuan Wood had their individual art practices to contend with too.",

            "The Kochi-Muziris Biennale, cofounded by Krishnamachari and fellow artist Riyas Komu, has become an increasingly important blueprint for any art event rooted in the realities of a locality yet international in ambition and scope. Recent #MeToo allegations against Komu (posted on anonymous Instagram account @herdsceneand), however, have taken something of the shine off. Komu swiftly stood down from his post as secretary of the Kochi Biennale Foundation pending an investigation, and Dube, the biennial’s first woman curator (of this December’s fourth iteration), issued a statement saying, ‘I take the issue of women’s empowerment… seriously. It informs my curatorial deliberations and I try to practice what I preach’, while at the same time suggesting that the biennial itself was undergoing a ‘process of structural change’. That Kerala has experienced its worst flooding (483 recorded deaths) in almost a century may also have extended the biennial’s focus beyond Dube’s stated ambition to examine resistance to the influence of capital and spectacle on contemporary culture.",

Since then it’s hosted shows by Urs Fischer and Taryn Simon; new commissions by Rashid Johnson and Yin Xiuzhen, and a group exhibition made in collaboration with disabled professionals, featuring work by Cindy Sherman, Rob Pruitt and others. Garage is Moscow’s go-to destination for contemporary art, but with work already underway on the V-A-C Foundation’s vast Renzo Piano-designed exhibition space (in the former GES2 power plant), scheduled to open in 2019, it won’t have that monopoly for long. Zhukova however isn’t sitting on her laurels. In July, New York digital media company Vice bought a controlling stake in the Center’s Garage magazine, and aims to expand the publication’s global reach and produce its own digital channel. ",

Works from the collection are now an almost constant presence in the Benaki Museum, Athens, for instance, where this year Joannou cocurated a survey of work by the late Greek sculptor George Lappas. In June, while artist Roberto Cuoghi and his team were kiln-firing dozens of ceramic crabs as part of the artist’s Deste commission on Hydra, The Equilibrists opened at the Benaki, featuring a survey of young Greek art selected from open submission and through a hundred studio visits by New Museum curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Massimiliano Gioni. The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer – False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober – all owned by Joannou. ",

Plus, he looked a lot less creepy in his skivvies on the cover of The New York Times Magazine than did Jeff Koons nude and pumping iron in the pages of Vanity Fair.",

Lee’s approach, which has focused on organising prominent international exhibitions, including collateral shows at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], made their name – as well as her own. Now that Seoul has become a major node in the art market, Lee, whose gallery was founded in 1982 and represents approximately 50 artists, including Haegue Yang and the newly signed eighty-nine-year-old sculptor Kim Yun Shin (featured in this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/]), is more ambivalent about how helpful artworld hype can be. ‘I think we should not be “too excited” about the Korean art scene being globally recognized, becoming another art hub in Asia… Both galleries and artists should stay on their toes,’ she warned The Korea Herald. Now a family affair, with Lee’s children involved, Kukje is no doubt in it for the long haul.",

His lifework Project Row Houses (1993–) is a conversion, with the help of local artists, of six blocks of shotgun dwellings in Houston’s Third Ward neighbourhood into 40 houses blending arts venues, studios and a community centre. Subsequent projects have taken place in Los Angeles, Dallas, Florida, New Orleans, South Carolina and more. Appointed by President Obama to the National Council of the Arts in 2013, bestowed with a MacArthur Foundation ‘genius grant’ the following year, the avatar of artistic urban renewal spent part of this year in Athens, working on a project (likely immigration-related, he told ArtReview this past summer) for next year’s Documenta.   ",

The estimated €101 million renovation of the Neue Nationalgalerie started this year, and the museum is projected to be closed for four years. Meanwhile, a new £80m, 14,700sqm modern art institution is planned for a site next door. You may be forgiven for asking whether, with all these capital projects, Kittelmann still has time to think about art. He does: projects in 2015 have included putting together an Andreas Gursky show at the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden-Baden, the Impressionism–Expressionism show at the Alte Nationalgalerie and a Mary Heilmann and David Reed show at the Hamburger Bahnhof: ‘He makes art out of other people’s art because his curatorial moves are really things that we wouldn’t have thought of,’ said Heilmann.",

Although philosopher Ray Brassier was resisting attempts to call the philosophical approaches dubbed ‘speculative realism’ a movement as far back as 2011, it’s hard to miss the fact that the term has become currency in artworld debates over the last few years, broadly indicating an avoidance of ‘anthropocentric’ or metaphysical ways of thinking about the world and human beings’ relationship to it. \n\nBut while last year’s four figures remain individually influential in their field, Harman is perhaps the thinker who has done most to popularise his own strand of ‘object-oriented philosophy’ to a wider public, especially when it comes to bringing those ideas to the artworld– lecturing at art colleges as much as in philosophy departments. Prolific, diplomatic and energetically networked, Harman draws followers and provokes enemies in equal measure (Timothy Morton, writing in this issue, is keen on Harman’s work; Artforum, by contrast, published a long attack on Harman in its summer issue). What’s undeniable is Harman’s ability to influence artistic and curatorial thinking when the reference points in politics, art and the humanities have never been more unstable.",

It will be a ‘decentralised celebration’, in the words of Lasvignes, who announced some 50 exhibitions and 15 dance and music performances across 40 partner institutions in France and its overseas territories. Blistène meanwhile managed to secure a donation of 350 works of Russian art from the 1950s to now, to complement the museum’s 120,000-strong collection – the largest of modern and contemporary art in Europe. Not impressed? Well, then maybe the recent announcement of a Centre Pompidou in Brussels will do the trick.",

Yet for all the solemnity of its historical themes, Kentridge is an artist with market clout to match his impressive institutional record. A survey of his work was held at the Kunstmuseum Basel during the prestigious slot coinciding with the city’s art fair, a precursor to a double-whammy institutional outing that opened this summer in Cape Town: a show at the Norval Foundation focuses on Kentridge’s sculpture from 1984, while Zeitz MOCAA is exhibiting his drawings, printmaking, films and tapestries. A show, as curator Azu Nwagbogu succinctly puts it, both ‘humongous and momentous’. To top that, the artist landed Japan’s Praemium Imperiale in September, with its 15 million yen honorarium.",

That ten years of work was thus sacrificed has a certain poignancy, given that Paglen’s practice is a study of the relationship between aesthetics and power. In September, however, and working with researcher Kate Crawford, he garnered virallike coverage when he revealed that ImageNet, a dataset that trains artificial intelligence systems in visual recognition, was packed with racist bias and assumption. As a result, 600,000 images were removed. A flurry of exhibitions followed: a solo show in the Barbican’s Curve in London; Training Humans, a show by Crawford and Paglen at the Fondazione Prada in Milan; and Paglen’s Nam June Paik Prize presentation in South Korea.",

So began Artsy, with Cleveland gaining an impressive range of early investors, including Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Google’s Eric Schmidt, the collector Dasha Zhukova and the gallerist Larry Gagosian, who together pitched in $14.5 million, with Marc Glimcher as an adviser. \n\nBesides being a database of works from more than 400 foundations and public collections, the website also hosts work by commercial galleries for sale – and major galleries are using the platform, perhaps drawn by the distinctive feature of individual pages for each dealer. Many have tried to crack the online art market before; most have failed. With its sleek design, commissioned editorial texts and the partnerships it has struck, Cleveland might just have succeeded with Artsy.",

            "From the late 1980s to the early 2000s, Spanish-born Entrecanales and her then-husband, Digby Squires, ran the the Delfina Studio Trust, providing studios for a generation of British artists, as well as an international residency programme. When the couple separated, the studios remained with Squires. Entrecanales’s patronage entered a lull, until a friend took her on a trip to Syria. \n\nIn 2007, the Delfina Foundation in its current incarnation, with a residency programme that supports artists and curators from all over the world, but with a particular focus on Latin America and the MENASA region, was born. And while the base is in London, the partnerships Entrecanales and foundation director Aaron Cezar have formed – with institutions and initiatives in Brazil, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, the UAE and Mexico – and the international nature of the artists supported (at the time of writing, the foundation is hosting a curator and artists from Mumbai, Istanbul, Berlin, Amman and São Paulo) mean that the patron’s influence is global.",

He remained in charge, however, of the K11 Art Foundation, which holds exhibitions in its various branded venues (tied to New World’s property portfolio) and arranges discussion forums – labelled ‘Salons’, this year in Seoul, London and Saudi Arabia – as well as artist residences. Also in 2024: the inaugural K11 Artist Prize, designed to support emerging Asian artists and spearheaded by the foundation’s International Council, featuring prominent collectors Sarah Arison and Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo [https://artreview.com/artist/patrizia-sandretto-re-rebaudengo/], and cultural strategist Alia Al-Senussi among its members. Cheng said his resignation permits him more time for public service, which includes chairing the Hong Kong government’s Mega Arts and Cultural Events Committee, responsible for providing incentives to major international events (such as Art Basel’s HK edition), and the various museum boards he attends, including New York’s MoMA PS1 and the Met, Paris’s Centre Pompidou and London’s Tate and Royal Academy of Arts.",

With its rakish reputation, the gallery was always going to be at home in the Marais in Paris, where it opened a fourth official space in October with a group show that typically mixed Brazilian and international names. ‘Official’ because the restless trio don’t tend to contain themselves solely to their addresses in São Paulo (a warehouse mothership), Brussels (opened in 2017) and their New York TriBeCa gallery. They spent their summer staging a group show at a seventeenth-century church in the bucolic Dutch coastal village of Retranchement, with a large group show of works on paper by artists including Michael Dean and Mariana Castillo Deball; while a show by painter Marina Perez Simão was the fourth to be staged at Villa Era, a nineteenth-century estate in the Italian countryside. Now they’ve refurbished a property in Upstate New York for residencies, starting with Paulo Nazareth and Paulo Monteiro.",

At least in part, the growing mightiness of the African artworld is down to the curator’s own efforts. As the director of Cape Town’s Zeitz MOCAA since 2019, and having established her name through the RAW Material Company in Senegal, Kouoh has become a leading light at home and abroad. Current shows at the institution include solos for Ghanaian-American artist Rita Mawuena Benissan [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-november-2024/#:~:text=Rita%20Mawuena%20Benissan] and South African Nolan Oswald Dennis. Earlier this year, Kunstmuseum Basel opened When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting [https://artreview.com/a-century-of-black-figuration-in-painting-review/], a survey exhibition curated by Kouoh that debuted at Zeitz. Not that it has all been plain sailing: in June, the artist Tracey Rose lambasted Kouoh and Kunstmuseum Bern, claiming that a work about Palestine had been censored [https://artreview.com/kunstmuseum-bern-hosting-tracey-rose-retrospective-branded-despicable-by-artist/] in her solo show at the Swiss institution, curated by Kouoh. Earlier this year, Kouoh oversaw Zeitz MOCAA’s annual gala, the proceeds of which help fund its educational and curatorial programming.",

            "Zaatari’s solo show at Moderna Museet, Stockholm, in the spring of 2015 demonstrated just how prolific the Lebanese artist is. Alongside the gallery displays – various relatively recent installation works that exemplified Zaatari’s formalist interest in archives and how media, particularly photography, is read in the context of changing histories and political flux – the institution also included a screening room with films from throughout the artist’s career. \n\nHere Zaatari’s abiding interest in identity and the personal narrative came to the fore. While his work typifies an ongoing turn to questions concerning the role of archives in art, its exhibition internationally (screenings and group-show contributions this year include MOMA, New York; Artspace, Auckland; and the Biennial of Graphic Arts, Ljubljana, among others) has, more specifically, engendered a wider interest in photography from the Middle East.",

            "‘Maybe the human thing is over,’ posited the artist Julia Scher on restaging her 1998 installation Wonderland at Esther Schipper’s Berlin gallery in December. That work is a prescient take on the power of tech, and Schipper’s taste chimes with our increasing awareness of technological and ecological crisis. She works with Hito Steyerl (whose Serpentine Gallery show this year focused on AI), Pierre Huyghe (curator of an Okayama Art Summit that foregrounded nonhuman intelligences), Philippe Parreno (who created an ‘autopoetic automaton’ for the refurbished MoMA, New York), Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster and Tomás Saraceno. Those two collaborated on a show spread across the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza and TBA21 in Madrid this year that, its curator claimed, posed ‘questions surrounding technologies, artificial intelligence, the collective minds of animals, and the power and attraction of the unknown’. If the future is posthuman, then Schipper has it covered.",

At the end of last year she opened Japanorama at the Pompidou Metz, exploring the country’s artistic production from the postwar era to the present and centred around her favoured theme: the posthuman body. That was followed by a retrospective exhibition of iconic 1980s avantgardists Dumb Type at the same institution. And Hasegawa continued to make France a mini-Japan in July, with Fukami, a show exploring Japanese aesthetics via traditional and contemporary works of art at Paris’s Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild. ‘You could call my perspective post avantgarde to the extent that I highlight artists who developed their practices at a distance from Western influence,’ Hasegawa told Numéro magazine at the time. That’s not to say that she’s avoiding Western influences, however, as a solo exhibition of work by Francis Alÿs, curated at Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum in November, will surely prove.",

Gallery artist Cao Fei this summer became the first Chinese artist to have a solo show at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, while Vitamin’s commitment to finding new ways of living as much as selling was reiterated when Hu turned up at Berlin’s Haus der Kulturen der Welt in April to discuss ‘alternative conditions for living together’. Similar sentiments were expressed in Danh Vo’s solo exhibition at the Mirrored Gardens, ‘a space grown out of anything the artist has chanced upon or anything that has found its way to the artist’, and a long-awaited solo show by Chu Yun opened this month.",

With the Städelschule role comes the directorship of the university gallery Portikus, where exhibitions this year have included Jos de Gruyter & Harald Thys, Amy Sillman (the school’s professor of painting), Shahryar Nashat and Lawrence Abu Hamdan. In 2016, however, Pirotte flexed his curatorial muscles (in addition to his continued advisory role to the Kadist collection, in Paris) on a far bigger project, La Biennale de Montréal, which he’s titled Le Grand Balcon, a reference to Jean Genet’s 1957 play Le Balcon. Favouring a younger generation, the biennial includes Nashat again, together with the likes of Luke Willis Thompson and Haig Aivazian, with room for some more ‘seasoned’ players as well, not least Thomas Bayrle and the curator’s compatriot Luc Tuymans.",

Artists with new books and editions from the gallery’s publishing arm include Shio Kusaka, Ann Collier and Joanne Tatham & Tom O’Sullivan.

Those working in the very top end of financial services might be the types to own one of Wool’s works after all: Apocalypse Now sparked column inches in 2013 when it sold for $26.4m at auction. More to the point, though, Wool as a painter represents a progression from the medium’s obsessions with formalism (though don’t think for a moment his deceptively simple compositions aren’t heavily worked) into conceptualism: his distinctly painterly investigations of the relationship between language and image reverberate, not least in the work of big shots such as Josh Smith and Wade Guyton from a generation below. ",

The gallery, one of the founding members of the Gallery Climate Coalition (a nonprofit launched in October with the aim of developing an industry-wide response to the climate crisis) has long been making sales ‘based purely on images’, Logsdail junior told Forbes, and as such the disruption wasn’t going to faze them: an online screening and exhibition programme launched in May. They did however open a galley in the Hamptons, where many monied New Yokers chose to sit out lockdown, and quickly set a sales record for Stanley Whitney, selling a painting for $850,000. Likewise, with the physical Frieze art fair in London cancelled, Lisson opened a new temporary space in Mayfair (leased until March). While London and New York City went in and out of lockdowns, the gallery’s one-year-old Shanghai premises staged shows for Shirazeh Houshiary and Julian Opie, with the latter launching multiple public art projects in the city.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

There was an established market and the contemporary artists we were working with weren’t part of that,” industrialist Rajeeb told the same audience. Given the considerable number of local and international institutions now affiliating themselves with the Samdanis’ initiative, as well as visitor numbers reaching almost half a million for the sixth edition, in 2023, there is clearly more enthusiasm at this stage. The biennial summit may be skipping a year (the seventh edition will open in 2026), but such momentum has led the couple to envision Srihatta, the 40-hectare art centre and sculpture park they are building in Sylhet, scheduled to open in 2025. There are also various advisory and museum patrons’ committees to keep them busy, including Tate, Alserkal Avenue and Asia Society.\n\n*Last Year 96 (with Diana Campbell [https://artreview.com/artist/nadia-rajeeb-samdani-diana-campbell-betancourt/])",

The Financial Times agreed: ‘Pedrosa’s thoughtful, serious approach showcases the joys and opportunities, as well as the trauma, of displacement and marvellously balances aesthetic pleasure and politics.’ Yet opinion was far from unanimous: the works on show, The Art Newspaper thought, ‘measured by technical rather [than] representative properties, are, frankly, ropey’; Folha de S.Paulo complained that Pedrosa ‘reduced the artists to slogans’. Pedrosa’s interest in identity will be familiar to visitors of Museu de Arte de São Paulo, where he is director (with an extension into neighbouring premises opening in March), where he uses a different theme every year to programme.

            "Ashkal Alwan, the Beirut-based cultural association founded by Tohmé in 1994, continues to be a driving force in advocating for artists in the region. Aside from generating a thriving local arts scene, Tohmé has become an expert at building networks across the Middle East, North Africa and beyond – an invaluable mission in a country struck by ongoing conflict. In addition to its exhibition programme (including a major show of Simone Fattal’s drawings in 2024) and free educational programmes for artists (workshops this year were led by the likes of Haig Aivazian, Marwa Arsanios and Joe Namy), the organisation ran a series of artist-film screenings at Beirut’s Sursock Museum. It was also one of the venues for ‘Why Germany’, an international lecture series reflecting on the recent crackdown on free speech in that country, for which it invited writer and academic Yasmeen Daher to consider the evolution of the Palestine solidarity movement. Tohmé’s skills as a cultural organiser are likely to have played a part in her recent appointment as director of the next Istanbul Biennial [https://artreview.com/christine-tohme-to-curate-18th-istanbul-biennial/].",

            "‘My interest is always to break down the distance between what we think [of] as art or high art and what we do in our daily life,’ Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] once told The Korea Herald. During his close-to-40-year engagement with what has been characterised as relational aesthetics, the Thai artist has become known for his participatory events, from cooking pad thai for gallery goers to providing them with ping-pong tables. You’d think it might be tricky to encapsulate such a career in a retrospective, but his MoMA PS1 survey, which closed in March, before moving to LUMA Arles in June, had a go, as did a second retrospective at Gropius Bau, Berlin, which opened in September, serving curry and Turkish coffees, and providing hangout spaces where the interactions are the work.\n\nGiven the social aspect of his practice, it is unsurprising that Tiravanija hasn’t hidden himself away in his studio: he has also established himself as a consummate curator. Building on his curating of the triennial Okayama Art Summit in 2022 and cocurating of the Thailand Biennale in 2023 [https://artreview.com/thailand-biennale-2023-the-open-world-chiang-rai-review/], he oversaw this year’s edition of Art Spectrum, a biennial exhibition featuring the next generation of Asian artists, including Heecheon Kim [https://artreview.com/heecheon-kim-keeping-it-real/], Riar Rizaldi [https://artreview.com/riar-rizaldis-theory-of-many-worlds/] and Vivien Zhang, which was held at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul. You might see the last, which was as diverse as it was intriguing, as an extension of the artist’s ongoing teaching activities (at Columbia University, New York) and his support of Gallery Ver, a commercial gallery space in his native Thailand. One thing’s for sure though, Tiravanija is as open and generous to other artists as he is to those who attend and at times become a part of his exhibitions; even if repetitive, it is effective, offering a form of openness that feels increasingly relevant to artists, given the fractious nature of our current times. Amidst everything else, Tiravanija also found time to contribute two new works to this year’s Forest Festival [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-september-2024/#:~:text=of%20Arata%20Isozaki-,Forest%20Festival%20of%20the%20Arts%20Okayama,-Various%20venues%2C%20Okayama] in Okayama (which included a series of textile works and ceramic bowls, offering visitors a lunchbox filled with locally sourced ingredients), an exhibition in Montreal, where he hosted a rehearsal space for local bands, as well as a roomsize installation at Pilar Corrias in London, just in time for Frieze Week.",

Continua’s Beijing space opened in 2005. This year, while most dealers were chasing collectors to ex-urban resorts of the rich, Continua took a punt on central Paris (as well as a popup for Anish Kapoor in Dubai). ‘There was sadness’ to the shuttered city, Fiaschi told The Art Newspaper. They opened, he added ‘to generate smiles’, first with a JR-curated exhibition pre-refurb, followed by two group shows. Still undergoing renovation is the controversially privatised Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo, where the gallery staged a small show of Cuban artists in anticipation of opening a space within the complex. Also conflicted is the trio’s operation in Cuba, which some Cuban activists have accused of legitimising the government.",

Yet controversy shifted into crisis when it emerged late last year that the organisation had overspent by €7m, leading the Kassel branch of Germany’s far-right AfD party to sue Szymczyk and CEO Annette Kulenkampff for mismanaging public funds (they were cleared in August of any wrongdoing). That the exhibition had been politicised was confirmed in October by the removal of Olu Oguibe’s Monument to Strangers and Refugees (2017) from Kassel’s central square by the local government. Szymczyk might have been guilty of overreach, but his radical decentring of the quinquennial – twinned exhibitions complemented by expansive publishing and public programmes exploring indigeneity, antifascism, resistance, identity and marginality – provoked conversations that feel increasingly pressing. Not to mention that his recent travails reveal the upped stakes in the European culture wars. His next move is attended with interest.",

            "While he may not have curated any biennials himself in the past year (albeit with São Paulo and Jakarta recently under his belt), Esche was a cocurator of the NSK State Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, making a sort of temporary floating embassy for the territory-less artist-state. Esche is also both an adviser to the Rijksakademie, Amsterdam, and a director of London publishing house Afterall. ‘It’s important that we constantly stretch the definition of what “making art public” means in terms of exhibitions,’ Esche told ArtReview last year, and the programme at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, which he has directed since 2004, reflects this: a new three-year exhibition titled The Way Beyond Art showcases some of the socially engaged and expanded practices that Esche champions, like Chto Delat and Can Altay. The Van Abbe also supports archival research and revision under its ‘Deviant Practice’ grants. Esche remains dedicated to exploring the limits of the contemporary museum. ",

            "Luc Tuymans is increasingly happy to fire shots at the artworld. Last year he bemoaned that ‘having a network’ was being confused with being a good curator (something which will be tested by his curating of a James Ensor show at the Royal Academy, London, this month). This year he told the Brooklyn Rail that ‘a good painting is a bad painting in a photograph’, a broadside perhaps to the kind of abstraction that is being traded over Instagram. He played on the relationship between the canvas and the lens further with a series of works debuted at Zeno X in September, a show marking 25 years of working with the Antwerp gallery. Insert I, II, III and IV are paintings of iPhone photographs of his own works that Tuymans shot during a 2013 solo show at the Menil Collection, Houston. Lenses of a different kind were a subject of his exhibitions at the Museum aan de Stroom (a homecoming gig) and currently at the National Portrait Gallery, London, featuring as their motif only his works that include spectacles.  ",

Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes. \n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there’s Slotover’s influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city’s East End.",

His big hits might be behind him (for now at least), but the voracious mingling of art, architecture, ecology and new technology continues unabated. A solo exhibition at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, which featured old classics as well as new commissions (including Under the Weather, 2022, a huge elliptical patterned screen hanging above the building’s courtyard that changes as the viewer moves about), was also a chance to launch a trippy ever-changing colour-field virtual-reality NFT (commissioned by Beeple collector Metakovan). The artist’s aim – whether he’s producing gallery shows (in Seoul, Madrid, Los Angeles), institutional exhibitions (additional solos at Castello di Rivoli and Munich’s Pinakothek), largescale outdoor commissions (for a Californian winery, or in the Qatari desert) or magazine covers (produced for Time ahead of COP27) – is to make the viewer acutely aware of their – and the – environment.",

Golden has ably stewarded the Studio Museum of Harlem for the past 15 years, renewing its curatorial and educational programming (Legacy Russell was appointed associate curator in 2018), creating one of the most sought-after residency programmes in the US and updating its physical plant with a $122m purpose-built, David Adjaye-designed building. This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration – something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Last year Sandretto Re Rebaudengo was named president of Fondazione Arte CRT, which supplies loans and new work to the Turin Civic Gallery (GAM) and Castello di Rivoli, as well as site-specific commissions for OGR Torino, and has since doubled the foundation’s annual acquisitions budget to €1m. The patron, whose Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo has amassed a collection of more than 1,500 artworks, has long had exhibition spaces in Turin and neighbouring Guarene, but in recent years she’s been expanding her reach: she’s turning a Venetian island into an art centre (set to open next year), and the Madrid wing of the Fondazione is now homing in on a permanent HQ. Sandretto also sits on committees at New York’s MoMA, New Museum and CCS Bard, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, London’s Tate Modern, Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum and Barcelona’s Fundación MACBA, among others. At her eponymous Turin foundation meanwhile, she gave solo shows to The Otolith Group, Stefanie Heinze and Bekhbaatar Enkhtur.",

Still, a routine year for Enwezor nevertheless involved Performa’s annual gala being dedicated to him; officially this was for his catalytic role in raising the visibility of South African art, though the visibility of art from all of Africa and the diaspora would, surely, be very different without Enwezor’s evangelising over the 20 years since his first major curatorial project. Meanwhile, the typically ambitious programme he oversees at Munich’s Haus der Kunst included major monographic shows (James Casebere, Michael Buthe and an upcoming one by Joana Hadjithomas & Khalil Joreige), and the whopping global survey Postwar – Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic 1945–65. In January he signed on for another five years at HDK: a no-brainer on its part, though Enwezor will no doubt pop up in many other places too. ",

            "‘There were some difficult times after the biennale was pushed back,’ said Kim, the president of the Gwangju Biennale Foundation. Postponing the exhibition, curated by Defne Ayas and Natasha Ginwala, to February 2021 means organisers will miss the 40-year anniversary of the Gwangju Uprising, the brutally suppressed democracy protests the event memorialises. Symbolism is important for Kim, evident not least in her Real DMZ project, which has seen art placed within the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea and its border area since 2012. A work by Soyoung Chung, presented in collaboration with the Real DMZ’s Negotiating Borders 2, had an afterlife at the Curitiba Biennial, which closed in February. Kim got a show by Belgian artist Francis Alÿs up and running at Tai Kwun Contemporary, Hong Kong, and took the reins (with SooJin Lee) of a huge Lee Bul retrospective, Utopia Saved, at St Petersburg’s Manege Central Exhibition Hall.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

While HKW was closed at the start of the year, they continued much of their programme, such as the ongoing thread The New Alphabet, exploring alternative forms of learning, online. From the summer, the two-year project Investigative Commons was launched, following on a long collaboration with Forensic Architecture, exploring how we might re-establish notions of public truth, while the exhibition and publication Illiberal Arts addressed the inequities at the heart of liberal capitalism. The multistrand, fast-paced programme has continued with the oral history project Archive of Refuge, turning to the memories of people who migrated to Germany over the past 70 years, and working towards the conference series The White West: Whose Universal? next year. Alongside the institution’s director Bernd Scherer, Franke continues to push at the idea of what a contemporary institution can be.",

Curated by the gallerist and Francesco Bonami, the exhibition, like the architecture housing it, sought to ‘fuse elements of historicism with modernity’. Yan was the subject of a solo show at De Carlo’s second Milanese gallery in September, while fellow painter Jamian Juliano-Villani (pictures of Amy Winehouse, goats wearing Ugg boots, a dog waving a knife), took over the London space over the summer. She was followed by the more minimal, abstract canvases of McArthur Binion (who also exhibited, earlier this year, in De Carlo’s Hong Kong gallery), described by the Financial Times as ‘some of the finest and most thoughtprovoking contemporary paintings to be seen in Europe right now’.",

This vital resource for scholars and art historians, cofounded 19 years ago by Claire Hsu, now has over 80,000 records in its collections, stretching from exhibition catalogues and materials to artist’s personal archives. But it’s not all about art history for the nonprofit organisation, which also responds to the times and looks to set the agenda through talks, residencies and research that complement its ever-expanding library. In March, for example, it held an exhibition of the late Singaporean performance artist Lee Wen’s sketchbooks and plans to celebrate its 20th anniversary next year with a busy programme. One highlight of which is a collaboration with Jakarta-based educational project Gudskul for Art Basel Hong Kong.",

It is not just the high profile at home that marks out the gallery, but the global network that its geographically-diverse artist roster has firmly infiltrated. Wilfredo Prieto represented Cuba at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], while WangShui, Bárbara Sánchez-Kane [https://artreview.com/barbara-sanchez-kane-new-lexicons-for-embodiment-kurimanzutto-new-york-review/] and Ana Segovia were in the main show; Haegue Yang [https://artreview.com/artist/haegue-yang/] showed in London and Chicago; Minerva Cuevas exhibited at CC Foundation, Shanghai; and the gallery worked with peers Shibunkaku for a presentation at Art Collaborations Kyoto. Kurimanzutto’s satellite space in New York gives them clout there, too: this year, the Met installed specially commissioned architectural interventions by Nairy Baghramian and Petrit Halilaj, and in February the gallery announced the representation of the estate of the late New York icon John Giorno.",

            "Confident enough that their website is blank apart from an email address, Neuger and Riemschneider are a cornerstone of the Berlin gallery scene: from 1994 onwards, they were instrumental in breaking barely known artists such as Rirkrit Tiravanija, Olafur Eliasson, Tobias Rehberger and Michel Majerus. This year marks 20 years since they moved to their Mitte headquarters, and 25 since they began working with Jorge Pardo, an anniversary celebrated by a recent show. Elsewhere in the programme were thoughtful group shows on negation and the construction of selfhood, a loopily cerebral Mario García Torres exhibition involving an animatronic tortoise and performances by Austrian screen legend Helmut Berger, a stormily politicised James Benning presentation and, demonstrating that Neuger and Riemschneider won’t be pinned down, a display of paintings by Billy Childish.  ",

He celebrated – how else? – with a show of Beuys’s works on paper at his London gallery at the start of the year, and another at Ropac’s Seoul branch at the end of the year. Having opened in Salzburg in 1983, and adding two London and two Paris spaces along the way, Ropac landed in South Korea in 2021 and this year doubled the square meterage there by adding another floor, allowing for a simultaneous exhibition of Donald Judd’s sculptures and paintings in September. As well as some of the great American estates, Ropac has become the de facto rep for canonical artists of the German-speaking world, among them VALIE EXPORT, Anselm Kiefer, Not Vital and Imi Knoebel. Georg Baselitz turned eighty-five this year, so there were more celebrations to arrange, with shows staged by the painter at nine institutions around the world, including at London’s Serpentine galleries and Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich.",

Picking up the bill to the glam event – a fundraiser for the long-running New York performance biennial – was Chang, the founder of the Beijing-based Domus Collection (and collector of Johnson’s work). Live art is an expensive business, with little in the way of a market to help it along, and Chang, as president of Performa’s board, has been a major backer. Yet it’s not just cutting-edge work that attracts Chang: he’s a (heavily involved) trustee at the Royal Academy in London, as well as vice chair of the International Council at Tate. Of course this is just the public face of Chang’s patronage. As an avid collector, he is searching out, he once told ArtReview, works that have ‘truth and beauty’; when Chang favours an artist, he becomes a supporter in more ways than one.",

The artist had removed her work from Documenta in 2022 [https://artreview.com/hito-steyerl-says-she-has-no-faith-in-documenta-tackling-antisemitism/] due to what she perceived as inaction by its curators over antisemitism, and was scathing of many of her peers who had publicly criticised Israel, telling The Guardian that many were merely practising ‘art as social media performance’. Furthermore, she bemoaned that it was those who only condemn violence on one side ‘that dominate the debate’. Steyerl’s engagement with the conflict comes as no surprise: questions of power, violence and mediation have been her subject matter for two decades now, parlayed into her video essays and multimedia installations. This year she premiered three new works that take the Nord Stream oil pipeline system as their subject at the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, and settled into her new role as professor in Emergent Digital Media at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.",

            "Yayoi Kusama’s 2018 exhibition at Victoria Miro in London drew some 92,000 visitors. For her show at David Zwirner, which opens in November and features a new Infinity Mirrored Room, they’re expecting 100,000 people, lines around the block and – of course – one hell of a presence on Instagram. Kusama’s polka dots, pumpkins, polished metal balls and mirrors are the I-was-there backdrops of our time, regardless of their standalone quality. In this regard, Kusama is a hugely important figure in the artworld’s transitioning and ballooning into – well, whatever it’s turning into, underwritten by social media and FOMO. The guaranteed turnstile action means she’s a huge draw with museums – and she’s had her own in Tokyo since 2017 – though there’s also an undervoiced case for her art speaking to the revival of interest in psychedelic experiences. What’s unarguable is the gratifying irony that the artworld’s hottest ticket is for shows by a pumpkin-obsessed ninety-year-old woman.\n\n",

Whether Museo Jumex offers that is yet to be seen: 2015 was a tumultuous year that saw accusations of censorship at the newly opened museum and the departure of its inaugural director. In the absence of a replacement being named, chief curator Julieta González continues to serve as interim director. It was perhaps an odd move too for a Mexican institution to take on a Guggenheim-curated touring show on Latin American art (Pablo León de la Barra’s Under the Same Sun), and the homegrown The Natural Order of Things received mixed reviews. Hosting solo shows for Jose Dávila and Walid Raad points to a welcome direction, however, for the man who remains one of Latin America’s most important collectors. ",

As the latter continue to expand both in terms of facture (higher-quality CGI, filming via drones) and how they’re nested in the expansive installations he produces with Lizzie Fitch, Trecartin is branching out in other directions: this year, he cocurated the New Museum’s Triennial, Surround Audience, which unsurprisingly was filled with artists negotiating the ravages of the digital age. \n\nThose duties didn’t prevent him, though, from participating in a dozen group and solo shows as well; curators recognise that, for the past decade, Trecartin has been – and remains – the artist who most naturally understands the Internet’s restyling of human subjectivity and the changing meaning of community. To ask where he’s going next is, most probably, to ask the same of the rest of us.",

Which is good, because what with Brazil’s political situation and the fact that a third edition of her boutique art fair did not materialise this year, she has had a lot to take in her stride. More positively, she had her work cut out with the many museum shows for the artists represented by her São Paulo-based gallery. In September the largest show of Cildo Meireles’s work ever staged in Latin America took over the galleries of Sesc Pompeia, showing the artist at both his most spectacular and subtly political. The six-decade survey of Anna Maria Maiolino’s work at the Whitechapel Gallery in London (complemented by a show back home in Strina’s Jardins space) was similarly comprehensive. Leonor Antunes, another of her artists to have a stellar year, represented Portugal at the Venice Biennale and won the Zurich Art Prize 2019.",

The cool middle-aged people were represented there, too: an exhibition of Michael Krebber’s austere works in May ‘still managed to piss people off’, reported Artforum. But it was a dead cool person who really stole the limelight in 2019. In the early 1950s, Andy Warhol collaborated with author Ralph Thomas (‘Corkie’) Ward on a series of self-published books. The first of these, A Is an Alphabet, a collection of 26 loose pages that feature Warhol’s cute illustrations and Ward’s weird rhymes – ‘a surreal, horny fairytale’, as Interview succinctly described it – went on show in Berlin before travelling to New York.",

            "While there’s never a year when Zürich isn’t important to the artworld – such is the buying power of the city’s collectors, both individual and corporate – the presence of Manifesta 11 in Presenhuber’s hometown further ensured that anyone going to Art Basel (on whose selection committee she sits) would pass through at some point during the summer. Indeed, one of the most eye-catching projects at the biennial was the placement of work by Torbjørn Rødland, represented by the gallery, in a local dentist’s surgery and in the group show at LUMA Westbau. During the biennial’s preview, Presenhuber also opened solo shows by Rødland along with Walead Beshty across her two gallery spaces and unveiled two outdoor sculptures by Mark Handforth nearby. A week earlier at Fondation Beyeler in Basel, an exhibition partnering gallery artists Fischli / Weiss and Alexander Calder had opened. In the end, though, what might seem a busy summer for some was just business as usual for Presenhuber.  ",

            "Perrotin, who disclosed last year that he would be selling a 60 percent stake [https://artreview.com/perrotin-in-negotiations-with-investment-management-to-sell-majority-stake/] in his gallery business to a French investment company, has announced this year that he will open a new London space inside Claridge’s hotel. This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

For to be the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art involves a lot of fundraising and a head for figures. These are likely prefixed by dollar signs and suffixed by ‘million’: the $650m needed to complete LACMA’s teardown-and-rebuild capital project; the $117.5m Govan secured from LA County in April. Or they might refer to missing square metres, after it emerged that Peter Zumthor’s design will include 10 percent less area than the planned 36,000sqm. Or be attached to the deal with Budi Tek’s Yuz Museum, with which LACMA will partner on a jointly owned foundation managing 90 percent of the Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur’s collection. Govan knows that making art accessible in California requires an unholy alliance of number crunching and celebrity: hence roping in Kanye West to donate $10m to James Turrell’s decades-awaited Roden Crater.",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

            "Artist, curator, institutional director – Al Qasimi can claim to belong to nearly every constituent sector of the artworld (albeit these days she’s not really that well known for her painting). Plus, in the real world, she’s royalty. And yet, in recent years she has leveraged her expertise and knowledge of art from the Gulf region and further afield, to operate in geographies beyond the Emirate and areas in which she can absolutely rely on royal privilege. An exhibition of paintings she curated by the senior Māori artist Emily Karaka, which opened this autumn at the Sharjah Art Foundation, of which she is also president and founding director, may be indicative of the direction planned for the 2026 Biennale of Sydney [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-lead-the-2026-biennale-of-sydney/]. Al Qasimi was this year appointed curator of the Australian survey, which she will work on while developing her plans for the 2025 Aichi Triennale [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-direct-aichi-triennale-2025/] in Japan, of which she is artistic director (the first non-Japanese person to occupy the position, although she speaks the language, having studied there). Having previously curated the Lahore Biennale (in 2020) and the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Al Qasimi is in demand, and her global presence is reflected in her home institution’s programming, which, in addition to Karaka, has featured survey exhibitions of South African multimedia icon William Kentridge, Brazilian painter Antonio Dias and Pakistani artist and Women’s Action Forum cofounder Lala Rukh, not to mention the annual March Meeting [https://artreview.com/the-top-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-march-2024/#:~:text=March%20Meeting%202024%3A%20Tawashujat] conference. Next February marks the opening of the 16th Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/] (Al Qasimi curated the 2023 edition [https://artreview.com/artists-for-2023-sharjah-biennial-revealed/], developing a programme initiated by the late Okwui Enwezor, having been involved with the event – as director – since 2003, when she cocurated the sixth edition). For this edition, Al Qasimi has appointed an all-female team of curators [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] that includes many of the leading lights among curators operating in the context of the global majority, including Sri Lanka’s Natasha Ginwala [https://artreview.com/artist/natasha-ginwala/], Indonesian curator Alia Swastika [https://artreview.com/artist/alia-swastika/?year=2024], Bahraini-Singaporean artist Amal Khalaf, New Zealand artist Megan Tamati-Quennell and Turkish curator Zeynep Öz. Moreover, in the context of an artworld in which cancellations and boycotts are rife – coming from every direction – and generating a consequent culture of fear, Al Qasimi remains one of the few voices still prepared to use the platform art (and royal privilege) affords them in order to express their opinions directly and to keep discussions that most people allow to fade away firmly in the spotlight, whether they concern the current carnage in Palestine and Lebanon or those suffering from other conflicts across the globe. Beyond all that, Al Qasimi also serves as president of the International Biennale Association, president of the hugely influential Africa Institute in Sharjah and on the board of Ashkal Alwan in Beirut. She is also on the advisory boards of the Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi and Darat al Funun in Amman. Beyond her involvement with art, she also founded the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, and earlier this year presented a clothing collection in London which was developed from the work of her late brother, who worked in the fashion industry. But beyond her personal achievements, Al Qasimi is also a symbol of the increasing influence of the Gulf region in the spheres of finance, commerce, politics, sports and entertainment, and, of course (but perhaps primarily by virtue of the first two elements on this list) art.",

            "There are many reasons why Matthew Marks is a perennial figure on this list, but all of them come back to the artists the New York and LA gallerist works with. King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‘Artists… like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.’ His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who’s who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks’s skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive. ",

The buzzing beasties added to the sense of claustrophobia generated by standing led screens showing layered, flicking, nightmarish images derived by running data from MRI brain scans through neural imaging networks. Yet Huyghe’s joining of the dots between man, machine and nature has never been comfortable, as the residents of Okayama are now finding. As director of that city’s second art summit, Huyghe has roped in 17 (Western) artists and collectives including Matthew Barney and Lili Reynaud-Dewar to create an exhibition as ‘living entity’ through which to ‘navigate heterogeneous things, chemical and algorithmic processes, as well as different intelligent life forms’. If this sounds natural for an artist long associated with Relational Aesthetics, it makes sense that the man who coined the term, Nicolas Bourriaud, included Huyghe’s work in the group show inaugurating the curator’s Contemporary Art Center of Montpellier.",

Organised chronologically and installed, as always, by the artist and his team (over 16 days and nights, he says), it provided an easy image of the photographer’s journey from nightclub imagery to a more wide-ranging experimentation in representing the world around him (and beyond: astronomy is a passion). Meanwhile, Fragile, a show touring African cities over the past five years, arrived at its final stop across two venues in Lagos; his solo at Mumok, Vienna, closed after an extended run in August. And then Tillmans was back in London for a round of fundraising on behalf of the ICA, where he has been chair since 2019. Demonstrating that his penchant for hedonism isn’t over, Tillmans outlined plans to make the art institution party central, including a licence to serve alcohol until 6am.",

Times change, but Gillick keeps his eye trained on the intersection of aesthetics and capital, as he has done for the past two decades. While his output ranges from architectural installation to sculpture, his videoworks took centre stage at the Madre Museum in Naples this summer. If his work affects the corporate aesthetic – his exhibition at Maureen Paley, London, in September consisted of slick architectural interventions and more films – then visitors to Kunsthalle Wien in July would have been reassured that Gillick puts his heart and soul into his work, as they witnessed the production of a feature film he is making with Austrian collective Gelitin. He is equally influential behind closed doors, sitting on the steering committee of Maja Hoffmann’s Luma Foundation. With such consistent success, Gillick’s blue Mondays should be few and far between.",

            "Gates is an artist who knows as much about the intricacies of planning law as he does about the inside of a studio. His sculpture was the focal point of a survey that opened in May at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, materially derived from dilapidated architecture and the urban realm, and specifically informed by Freedmen’s Town in Houston’s Fourth Ward. With regards to the latter, Gates is advising an initiative that plans to preserve this historic neighbourhood built and shaped by Black people following emancipation: an endeavour that’s in the mould of the socially engaged mini-empire he has been building on the South Side of Chicago since 2006. Over in Tokyo, the artist’s Afro-Mingei exhibition at the Mori Art Museum, which imagined ‘the artistic possibilities of combining Black aesthetics and Japanese craft philosophies to envision hybrid-culture futures’, laid the groundwork for incense and sake collaborations with small family-owned businesses in Japan. This mix of commerce and creativity made him an obvious choice for Prada’s diversity council, where Gates has spearheaded a mentorship programme for designers of colour.",

Even when the reality is a headless corpse. In 2015 his work was everywhere. His 2013 Gramsci Monument project in the Bronx was the subject of a documentary film by Angelo A. Lüdin. \n\nHis immersive installation Nachwirkung (Aftermath) opened at the Kunsthalle Bremen and his collages transformed the project room of the MAN in Nuoro, Italy. His installation in the Central Pavilion of the Venice Biennale simulated the collapse of that structure’s roof, and he brought a similarly apocalyptic scenario to the South London Gallery, complete with a quotation that takes the work back to Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci: ‘Destruction is difficult, indeed it is as difficult as creation.’ Difficult for some.",

            "Following on from several years of more hard-hitting, London-focused film projects – including the 2020 Small Axe series of five films that charted the lives of West Indian immigrants to the city, codirecting the documentary Uprising (2021) on a 1981 fire in South London, and his filmic monument Grenfell [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-will-not-look-away-serpentine-gallery-london/] (2023), a single-shot circling of the site of the tragic 2017 apartment block fire – the gap between McQueen’s art and cinema projects feels wider of late. This year, McQueen received a solo exhibition that continues to occupy both Dia sites in New York, with several film works and a new photographic series on display in the institution’s Chelsea space, and in a massive former factory site Beacon is his new installation Bass, the basement space filled only with coloured lighting and reverberating with snatches of music (The music an extended jam session, recorded in-situ, between different forms of the titular instrument, played by a stellar ensemble that included Meshell Ndegeochello and jazz veteran Marcus Miller.) The show received widespread acclaim, and will travel to Switzerland’s Schaulager next year. He also released the documentary Occupied City [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-review/], in which he slowly traced and filmed all the locations that appear in author, historian and producer (and McQueen’s wife) Bianca Stigter’s book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940–1945 (2019). Offering a meditative study of the Dutch capital under the Nazis, it was a cinematic tour de force that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.\n\nSo far, so auteur. McQueen’s second celluloid outing this year, Blitz, however, which opened to mixed reviews, demonstrated how mainstream he can go. Telling the story of a young boy during the World War II bombing of London, it was ‘an old-fashioned children’s adventure movie, a rollicking yarn that might have been on television on a Bank Holiday afternoon’, thought the BBC. ‘Shockingly conventional’, Variety noted. But McQueen seems confident straddling both documentary and fiction forms, as well as arthouse and (attempted) blockbuster modes, and continues to serve as a model to artists who might want to make work that can occupy the gallery, the cinema, as well as home streaming platforms.",

            "When Isa Genzken tells us to Make Yourself Pretty!, ArtReview reaches obediently for the powder compact, no questions asked. This emphatically titled exhibition – near double the size of the artist’s 2013 MoMA retrospective – came courtesy of Beatrix Ruf last December, a year after taking the helm of Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum. Long a champion of Genzken’s, this was the show in which the curator nailed her colours to the mast of that venerable institution. This April the show travelled to Berlin amid much homecoming fanfare. New York’s not forgotten Genzken quite yet, though: over the summer the artist’s nine-metre-high Two Orchids blossomed in Central Park. As for her influence on the coming generation? A quick spin around this year’s Turner Prize nominees turns up enigmatic assemblages, animistic concrete forms, urban detritus, weird clothing, New York pop culture – Genzken everywhere, in other words, peeping around the edges.  ",

That loss is not always a bad thing was perhaps the message of Brian Belott, the self-proclaimed ‘Master of Discard’, who closed the gallery with his thrift-store assemblages. Nor is Brown likely to mope: he had four artists in the international exhibition at the Venice Biennale – Ed Atkins, Frida Orupabo, Avery Singer and Golden Lion winner Arthur Jafa – with Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys representing Belgium. There were also shows for Alex Katz and Ella Kruglyanskaya in his Harlem space and Charlemagne Palestine and Laura Owens at his Rome outpost, while Karl Holmqvist joined the restaurant/gallery that Brown and Rirkrit Tiravanija run in upstate New York. This autumn there was a trip to Paris to stage a show at Galerie Patrick Seguin.",

Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

As chairman and CEO of luxury group LVMH, a little bit of his Bloomberg-estimated $97.3bn fortune goes to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. This year the private museum gave over its galleries to Gilbert & George, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Courtauld’s hallowed collection of Impressionism. The foundation’s smaller ‘espaces’ in Venice and Tokyo, meanwhile, hosted shows by Philippe Parreno and Christian Boltanski respectively. Yet it was an even more spectacular brand of philanthropy that put Arnault and his family in the spotlight this year, after they publicly announced a €200m donation to Notre-Dame while the cathedral was still smouldering (conveniently overshadowing the €100m earlier pledged by his nemesis François Pinault). Sceptics suggested that Arnault would benefit from a tax break (he says not), and sniping over this and other megadonations was only partially quelled when, in September, they were eventually signed off.",

            "The gallerists swelled their 43-strong roster with an additional four artists and an estate this year. This last was Robert Colescott, whose paintings, which Blum & Poe hung at their Los Angeles gallery in March, combined surrealism with satire to comment on the state of race politics. Also joining the gallery was young West Coaster Mimi Lauter, who had a show in May, Chicago-based Tony Lewis, Brazilian Solange Pessoa and Japan’s Tomoo Gokita. The gallery has had a presence in Gokita’s hometown of Tokyo since 2014, and it was there, in June, that it showed Agnès Varda. The New Wave filmmaker is undergoing something of a renaissance (and, in collaborations with JR, being embraced by the artworld). That the boys are championing an older artist proves something of a theme: they also gave octogenarian sculptor Wendell Dayton his first major solo show.",

Serve the Dominant Ideology or Stop Being a Pussy, Frances Stark’s first exhibition with the gallery since her old home, Gavin Brown’s enterprise, folded into Gladstone in 2020, opened in June and featured 12 paintings of open books. Another astute commentator on the artworld, artist David Salle, and the lucrative estate of Robert Rauschenberg also joined the gallery’s roster this year. With locations in New York, Brussels and Seoul [https://artreview.com/gladstone-gallery-to-open-new-seoul-space/], and artists ranging from Matthew Barney [https://artreview.com/matthew-barney-secondary-no-pain-no-gain/] to Marisa Merz and Rachel Rose (all of whom had shows), as well as the likes of Rirkrit Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] and Sarah Lucas (who have had significant shows elsewhere this year), Gladstone has colossal spread.

Their private museum, The Broad, in downtown Los Angeles, is one of the most important such institutions in the US, and while the couple have not historically been so adventurous in the nature of their acquisitions, they make up for this conservatism in sheer dollar spend. Their holdings include works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jasper Johns, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama and Andy Warhol, and they estimate they’ve made 8,500 loans to over 500 institutions around the world in their lifetimes. This year The Broad was bolder, making a statement by staging a new retrospective of Shirin Neshat. While highly decorated, the Iranian artist has never had a show on such a scale – opening in October, this vast survey includes approximately 230 photographs and eight videoworks – so the Broads can be credited with offering a corrective.",

This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

Then again, the collector (and MoMA board member) whose donations to the museum between 1997 and 2016 form this sweeping survey of Latin American art, Sur moderno: Journeys of Abstraction – The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift, is hardly your ordinary buyer. Her holdings, concentrating on art from Latin America, are constantly on loan, as well as increasingly being gifted directly to institutions. For example, the Reina Sofía in Madrid was given 45 works by 33 artists (all made since 1990) in March from the Phelps de Cisneros collection, a bequest that followed another donation of 202 works in January to Reína Sofia, MoMA and five other international museums. Hers is a name worth remembering for independent curators and scholars, too: Phelps de Cisneros is the purse behind various residencies and research fellowships, including the Independent Curators International’s annual travel grant.",

He will be its third director in eight years when he takes up the position in 2019. Biesenbach is not the stereotypical ‘safe pair of hands’, but while some of his exhibitions in New York have failed to garner critical acclaim, this is countered by lauded shows such as this year’s Cathy Wilkes solo at PS1, and his habit of championing artists the rest of us are yet to cotton on to. And there is no doubt he has the skills to steady the ship. Biesenbach knows that where he goes, attention is paid. The only blip this year came with a lawsuit issued by curator Nikki Columbus alleging that MoMA PS1 had offered her a curatorial position, only to rescind the offer when it found out that she was pregnant.",

Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

She ‘drafts’ shows like a draughtswoman, she says; ‘you curate pork to make prosciutto’. Either way, there was no filler this year at Turin’s Castello di Rivoli, of which she is director, and Cerruti Villa, which put its $600m collection of modern art on display for the first time. The former hosted exhibitions by artist Michael Rakowitz and Anri Sala. Yet the bulk of Christov-Bakargiev’s energy has this year been devoted to preparing the Cerruti collection – amassed by entrepreneur Francesco Federico Cerruti from the late 1960s to 2014 – for its big public reveal in April. Through a body of work ranging from Francisco de Goya’s The Disasters of War (1863) to Medardo Rosso’s The Jewish Child (1892), as well as more recent paintings by Francis Bacon, Alberto Burri and Pablo Picasso, the collection didn’t need much hyping.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

At the end of 2018, the forthcoming Whitney Biennial – at the museum he’s directed since 2003 – became a flashpoint for controversy when employees demanded the removal of board member Warren B. Kanders over his involvement with teargas manufacturer Safariland. This after the 2017 biennial had been embroiled in a war of words over its inclusion of a painting accused of sensationalising racist violence. This time around, Weinberg dithered, artists quit the biennial and Kanders eventually resigned. One sensed damage-control when, in September, the institution broke ground on David Hammons’s monumental public project Day’s End and Weinberg described the installation as representing ‘our commitment to community and civic good’. Meanwhile, the Whitney continued to settle into its downtown home, with a big Warhol retrospective and an emphasis on shows for artists of colour (Pope.L, Kevin Beasley, Derek Fordjour). How much reputational damage the biennial hullabaloo has caused in the long term remains to be seen.",

Back on home soil, the Glimchers took on the estate of Tony Smith (the gallery already represents his daughter, Kiki) and added young New York painter Loie Hollowell to the roster (‘Georgia O’Keeffe for the Instagram Age’, according to Vice). The gallery staged a museum-worthy, not-for-sale exhibition of Jean Dubuffet in London (marking 50 years since the late artist signed with Arne); David Hockney packed out Tate Britain and the Centre Pompidou; and 1980s star Julian Schnabel has been so busy since rejoining the gallery last year that Artnet.com was led to ask, ‘Is the Julian Schnabel Renaissance Officially a Thing?’",

While details remain sketchy (as they did for Art Basel’s 2018 foray into Buenos Aires, in a consultancy detail it extended this year), ‘highly immersive’ installations are promised, open to the public. Spiegler was seen padding around the booths of Frieze London, shoring up gallery commitment to Art Basel Hong Kong amid the ongoing unrest. Meanwhile, this year’s Art Basel Miami will be the second of the brand’s events to roll out sliding exhibitor fees, a move pioneered last year in Basel to support the participation of smaller galleries.",

For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter’s subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‘signature’ aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‘cult of personality’ he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‘It’s a frightening development,’ he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales – Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m – it’s been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman’s New York space in May). But his influence on painting globally remains big.  ",

            "Since 1977, when, after an early foray into multiples, she opened her New York gallery with a show by Marcel Broodthaers, Goodman has dedicated her considerable energies to promoting exchange between the American and European artworlds. She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

            "‘While I agree that there have been great strides in making things better, we still have a ways to go before there’s real parity,’ wrote Sherman as part of an online debate on sexism in the artworld earlier this year. ‘I am well aware that my prices aren’t anywhere near those of my male counterparts, and while it annoys the hell out of me, I also think, How can I complain when I’m still doing so well?’ Well, quite. By any yardstick, Sherman is pretty close to the top of the tree: number five this year on the major-exhibition-derived Kunstkompass rankings; number ten on the list of most expensive living American artists; number three on the list of most expensive living female artists. \n\nAuction prices are, of course, a dismal barometer of merit – so how about popular status? Sherman’s is such that one fan issued a free set of emojis, allowing Cindyphiles to communicate in her image. As for legacy, the Pictures Generation is now looked to as the spiritual forebear of the post-Internet generation as it grapples with a sea of rapidly proliferating, authorless images, the lack of disconnect between advertising and selfexpression, and the increasing commodification of self-image. Sherman has become an informal patron saint to every artist attempting to undermine the selfie or turn Instagram to her own purposes. If anyone can smash that glass ceiling, she’ll be the one to do it.",

(Her 2010 MoMA show was the most popular in the institution’s history, with 850,000 visitors, a number not quite matched by this year’s solos at Bundeskunsthalle, Bonn; Palazzo Strozzi, Florence; Sean Kelly, New York; and Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna, but boons for those spaces nonetheless.) Well get in the queue, because the performance artist’s exhibition schedule is booked to 2024. Abramović is famous enough to be lampooned by Cate Blanchett in a forthcoming Netflix comedy (‘Waiting for the Artist’, an episode of the Documentary Now! series screening next year) and attacked by an artist (a man smashed a portrait of Abramović over the artist’s head in September). Nor does the artist need to be present to make herself felt: the Marina Abramović Institute is increasingly active, staging, for example, eight performances by artists using her ‘method’ at this year’s Bangkok Art Biennale.",

A serial biennial curator, who also hops nimbly between the worlds of public institutions and private foundations, Gioni is artistic director of the Beatrice Trussardi Foundation in his native Italy and the curator of Dark Light: Realism in the Age of Post-Truth at the Aïshti Foundation in Beirut, which featured over 200 works from the collection of Tony and Elham Salamé and focused on the changing meanings of figuration in contemporary art. Proving he can also nip between the worlds of fashion and art, in Doha he is the cocurator of the current Valentino show, Forever Valentino, and, earlier this year, the Jeff Koons survey Lost in America.",

            "If Ai’s artmaking feels like a footnote to his media activism, don’t be fooled. The Albertina in Vienna staged his largest retrospective to date; while Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, had a smaller exhibition [https://artreview.com/how-to-be-a-real-artist-walter-benjamin-adorno-herzog-ai-weiwei-nathan-fielder/]; and his gothic La Commedia Umana (at more than 8-by-6 metres, one of the largest Murano glass sculptures ever made) hung in Venice’s San Giorgio Maggiore during the Biennale. Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

While the effects of that remain to be seen, she nevertheless managed to develop a programme at the Stedelijk that navigates seamlessly between her usual focus on art’s next hot young thing and reexaminations of work by more mature practitioners, as recent shows for Jana Euler and Jordan Wolfson, but also Jean Tinguely and Ed van der Elsken, demonstrate. Furthermore, Ruf’s strength has always been her ability to operate as a meta-curator, in various advisory and panellist roles. In January, she launched the first Verbier Art Summit around the question of whether museums should consider ‘de-growth’, and she continues to be one of the core advisers\u2028to Luma Arles.",

            "It has been a turbulent 12 months since the head of the four Tate galleries took the number one spot on this list. While discontent and protest ﬁtfully surfaced from the activist-left over BP’s corporate sponsorship, in the spring it was Serota’s detractors on the right who made the most noise. The conservative press gleefully stretched for Oscar Wilde clichés when Tate lost not one but two directors in quick succession. Was it carelessness on Serota’s part? Perhaps not, but Penelope Curtis leaving Tate Britain for Calouste Gulbenkian Museum after a much maligned ﬁve-year tenure, and Chris Dercon announcing his decision to jump ship from Tate Modern to direct Berlin’s Volksbühne (although he’ll be staying in the post until next summer) was not a good look for Serota. \n\nThe ten-storey extension, which dwarfs Tate Modern’s original building like a super cruiseliner on the Venetian skyline, is proving controversial too. Currently four years behind its original opening date – during which performance spaces in the power station’s old oil tanks, opened to much hype in 2012, have sat idle as construction continues above them – the additional space is still missing £30m of funding, although Serota says he is conﬁdent this will be found before the new launch date of June 2016. Last year’s top spot came in recognition of Tate’s vast international network of global acquisitions committees and internationally active curatorial teams. No change there. Nor has all the construction dented its exhibition programme (Tanks aside) and general popularity with punters: a(nother) record – 7.9 million visits across all four sites in 2014–15, with 5.7 million alone stepping into Tate Modern. But with his legacy projects nearing completion, is the sixty-nine-year-old eyeing retirement in some pleasant corner of Southern England?.  ",

            "‘An institution is a learning system’, Obrist told Forbes this year while discussing the ‘Year of AI’ at London’s Serpentine Galleries. Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

Their unique selling point is the lifestyle to which they can allow collectors access: the Fife Arms in Aberdeenshire, the couple’s first excursion into hospitality, was recently named The Sunday Times Hotel of the Year 2019. That trend continued with the opening of a gallery in St Moritz last December; a bookshop in Zürich, which doubles as HQ for the gallery’s publishing arm; and the announcement of a new exhibition space with a ‘robust’ education programme and a restaurant in Menorca in 2020. To fill these spaces, the gallery continues to hoover up artists: signings including Ed Clark, Annie Leibovitz, Glenn Ligon, Mika Rottenberg, Nicolas Party and the estate of John Chamberlain upped the firepower this year.",

Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",

            "The sister of Qatar’s ruling emir, Al-Mayassa is chair of Qatar Museums, giving her authority over a string of venues (including Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Islamic Art) and public art (such as the recently unveiled monumental sculpture by Rashid Johnson installed outside Doha International Airport) in the Gulf state. Soon to be added to this portfolio are the Lusail Museum, which will house the world’s largest collection of Orientalist paintings, and Doha’s Art Mill Museum (both slated to open in 2030), which will be ‘part global think tank and part art museum’ and feature international modern and contemporary work. The latter is already programming, co-organising Your Ghosts Are Mine: Expanded Cinemas, Amplified Voices during the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] with Mathaf and the Doha Film Institute (also under Al-Mayassa’s purview), an exhibition featuring the moving image work of 40 MENA-based artists. While in Venice, Qatar Museums signed a ‘protocol of co-operation’ to invest in Venetian heritage projects.",
