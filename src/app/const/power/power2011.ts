            "After ten years at the Pompidou’s helm, director Alfred Pacquement realised a longstanding dream this year with the opening of Pompidou-Metz, an outpost of France’s great modern and contemporary art museum. Many hopes are pinned on such regional branches, and the distinctive building – notably near the German border, designed by Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines, with a roof resembling a fallen net – is meant to beckon tourists on looks alone. It duly attracted 100,000 visitors in the first four days it was open. As well as an ongoing scheme to use vacant space at the Palais de Tokyo to show work by midcareer artists, Pacquement has announced plans for a ‘pop-up’ mobile Pompidou centre that will further the brand’s expansion. Oh, yes, and bring more art to the people. When it comes to world domination, it seems funding (currently holding up Pompidou Mobile) is the only thing standing in Pacquement’s way. That and the strikes which recently closed several of France’s leading museums for several days.",

Originally set up to acquire work from the Frieze Art Fair for Tate Modern, the group (whose membership and funding comprises a diverse collection of individuals) takes donors on studio tours, private receptions and international trips.\n\nYana Peel & Candida GertlerOutset has since expanded its influence, incorporating production funds, part bankrolling the British Venice Biennale pavilion, setting up branches in Munich and Israel, and donating to pretty much every London institution, notably funding to the South London Gallery’s new extension this year.

It has arguably the most comprehensive collection of documentary and archive material related to contemporary Asian art and, through its conferences and research programmes, remains the centre for discussion and dialogue in the region.\n\nIn some ways the pairing of Chang and Hsu is a little artificial – these days they are quite separate entities. The latter directs the AAA, and the former – a leading expert on the region’s art since the 1980s, and something of a guru to an emerging generation of artists and curators – remains an AAA board member while running the commercial gallery Hanart TZ, acting as an adviser to collectors such as David Tang, and curating, teaching and writing about Southeast Asian art internationally.\n\n",

            "Groys, currently professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at New York University and senior research fellow at the Karlsruhe University for Arts and Design, is a figurehead for how art is currently contextualised. In an interview for this issue of ArtReview, Groys dismisses art criticism as being an exercise in ‘aesthetic taste’ and champions theory-based thinking. A collection of his writing, titled Antiphilosophy, was released this year – following multiple others, including Art Power (from 2008) and Going Public (2010) – and The Guardian noted in its review that what becomes apparent from these essays is the author’s Marxist commitment to presenting philosophy not just as a way of interpreting the world, but as a weapon to change it. Such political, revolutionary grandstanding has made him ever more relevant to a post-Occupy artworld, and numerous invitations to write, deliver lectures and sit on panel discussions have since followed, including appearances at this year’s Documenta and the Kyiv Biennale.",

            "A year ago there was muttering in the Somerset town of Bruton, England, that the arrival of fancy artworld types might turn the ancient parish into a rustic playground for the global ultra-rich. Once they’ve pulled on their wellies, however, it turns out that Wirth and his wife, Manuela Hauser, are ready to get down with both the mud and the cultural enrichment of his new ’hood. Hauser & Wirth Somerset – a converted seventeenth-century farmhouse and grounds, featuring multiple free-to-enter galleries, outdoor artworks and a buzzy restaurant – opened in July to general artworld approval, but perhaps more importantly, with a neighbourhood-pleasing programme of talks, workshops and site-relevant residencies. How this commitment to grassroots engagement will evolve to fit the decidedly more urban terrain of downtown LA when the 9,300sqm Hauser Wirth & Schimmel opens for business next year remains to be seen.",

For Peyton-Jones, this next year will be her 25th at the helm of the once-humble Hyde Park institution. Her appearance on the society pages alongside Pharrell Williams and other Serpentine partygoers has long been de rigueur, but as a finalist for the 2015 Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Award, Peyton-Jones has been explaining how annual visitor figures reached almost a million across the Serpentine’s two galleries in 2014, and how 85 percent of their £7m turnover is raised from private sources.\n\nCodirector Obrist is, as ever, ubiquitous: outlining the ‘Museum of the Future’ in Doha; touring 15 Rooms to Shanghai; winning the International Folkwang Prize in Essen. ‘In a sense Obrist is a human aggregator,’ wrote Hal Foster, reviewing Obrist’s Ways of Curating in the London Review of Books, ‘almost a social-media-in-person or a hive-mind of one.’ As might be expected, Ways of Curating is but one of 17-odd books authored or coauthored by the hyperactive uber-curator this year – and his river of published interviews and conversation is in turn cited in dozens of other publications. Obrist’s 103,000 Instagram followers chart his ceaseless travel through the location of celebrity contributors to his Post-it notes project – Orhan Pamuk in Istanbul; Olafur Eliasson in Copenhagen; Bret Easton Ellis, John Baldessari and Miranda July in LA – such that it is sometimes easy to forget his ties to an institutional ‘home’.",

This year, the saga of e-flux’s bid to control the .art top-level domain extension took a new turn. Having lost out in the bidding, e-flux has partnered with the new owner, marketing .art to its extensive network. E-flux’s influence ensured that prominent institutions signed up straightaway (including the Stedelijk Museum and Para Site), with e-flux subscribers getting second dibs before the domain extension was put on wider sale. Meanwhile Vidokle, Aranda and Kuan Wood had their individual art practices to contend with too.",

Since then it’s hosted shows by Urs Fischer and Taryn Simon; new commissions by Rashid Johnson and Yin Xiuzhen, and a group exhibition made in collaboration with disabled professionals, featuring work by Cindy Sherman, Rob Pruitt and others. Garage is Moscow’s go-to destination for contemporary art, but with work already underway on the V-A-C Foundation’s vast Renzo Piano-designed exhibition space (in the former GES2 power plant), scheduled to open in 2019, it won’t have that monopoly for long. Zhukova however isn’t sitting on her laurels. In July, New York digital media company Vice bought a controlling stake in the Center’s Garage magazine, and aims to expand the publication’s global reach and produce its own digital channel. ",

Works from the collection are now an almost constant presence in the Benaki Museum, Athens, for instance, where this year Joannou cocurated a survey of work by the late Greek sculptor George Lappas. In June, while artist Roberto Cuoghi and his team were kiln-firing dozens of ceramic crabs as part of the artist’s Deste commission on Hydra, The Equilibrists opened at the Benaki, featuring a survey of young Greek art selected from open submission and through a hundred studio visits by New Museum curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Massimiliano Gioni. The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer – False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober – all owned by Joannou. ",

The estimated €101 million renovation of the Neue Nationalgalerie started this year, and the museum is projected to be closed for four years. Meanwhile, a new £80m, 14,700sqm modern art institution is planned for a site next door. You may be forgiven for asking whether, with all these capital projects, Kittelmann still has time to think about art. He does: projects in 2015 have included putting together an Andreas Gursky show at the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden-Baden, the Impressionism–Expressionism show at the Alte Nationalgalerie and a Mary Heilmann and David Reed show at the Hamburger Bahnhof: ‘He makes art out of other people’s art because his curatorial moves are really things that we wouldn’t have thought of,’ said Heilmann.",

Curator Massimiliano Gioni was quoted as noting that ‘without the foundation’s support, the show would have been simply impossible: it’s not exactly easy to borrow works from an artist in Siberia, who has no email and speaks no English’.\n\nVictoria also costaged the recent retrospective of Andrei Monastyrski at the Moscow Museum of Modern Art and the Francesco Bonami-cocurated exhibition Modernikon at Turin’s Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo; it has instigated a scholarship for international students to attend the Courtauld Institute, London; and it plans to set up a publishing wing to translate Russian theory to English, and vice versa.",

This has been a transformative year for Henrik Olesen – with a raved-about solo show at the Museum für Gegenwartskunst in a prime slot this summer – and for Pablo Bronstein, with shows at the Kunsthalle Charlottenburg and the ICA in London. Next year looks busy for homegrown talent Lara Favaretto, who will be included in Documenta 13 and has a solo exhibition at Rome’s MAXXI.",

I am doing a studio visit, and there on the artist’s shelf is a book by Kaja Silverman.’ Baker goes on to describe Silverman’s lectures as being ‘greeted with the kind of wild enthusiasm usually reserved for performances and concerts’. To call Silverman a feminist film theorist and art historian rather misses the point of her writing. In Flesh of My Flesh, her 2009 book, Silverman charts the modern obsession with uniqueness – the identity of difference and departmentalisation – bringing the text to a head through the work of Terrence Malick, James Coleman and Gerhard Richter.\n\nAfter the publication of that book Silverman left her teaching post at the University of California, Berkeley for the University of Pennsylvania; and this year the professor received the Distinguished Achievement Award – $1.5 million over six years – from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, to add to her 2008 Guggenheim Fellowship. That money should see her through the completion of The Miracle of Analogy, a book on photography in which Silverman continues an ongoing reappraisal of the Renaissance idea of analogy as a philosophical methodology.",

            "Qatar currently acquires more modern and contemporary art than any other country in the world, thanks to the ruling Al-Thani family’s hyperactive buying. Sheikh Saud bin Muhammad bin Ali Al-Thani has spent more money on art (several hundred million dollars, reputedly) than any other collector in the world over the past two years, and his relative Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, also a major collecting force, is chair of the Qatar Museums Authority (Christie’s chairman Edward Dolman recently left the auction house to run her office there as well as join the QMA’s board).\n\nThe family’s name crops up in relation to several international projects, including joint exhibitions with the Prada Foundation and bankrolling the Murakami exhibition at Versailles last autumn. There’s much being commissioned at home, too, with projects from Richard Serra and Jeff Koons in the pipeline (so to speak), art museums to be built and an identity as the Gulf’s most important cultural destination to be forged in time for the World Cup, which Qatar will be hosting in 2022.",

            "This year Filipovic made most institutional curators look like idlers. Three years into her directorship at Kunsthalle Basel, she’s lately been balancing the emphatic championing of women artists – solo shows in the last year for Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Sadie Benning, Maria Loboda – with rewardingly elliptical group shows like this past summer’s Ungestalt. That’d be plenty, but in the past year the Princeton-trained art historian has also published two (admittedly long-gestating) books: a substantial and brilliant study of the ‘apparently marginal activities’ of Marcel Duchamp that additionally serves as a sly exegesis on curating-as-art and an exhortation to artistic boldness, and a tightly researched Afterall ‘One Work’ volume on David Hammons’s iconic 1983 Bliz-aard Ball Sale. Even her predecessor in Basel might be looking on enviously, and he just directed Documenta. Filipovic is ambitious enough to do that too; but also smart enough to rewrite the script.",

This year’s Piccadilly Community Centre, in which everything from a charity shop to tango-dancing clubs and bell-ringing lessons found a home, proved a deft game of double bluff – the community centre was installed within the shell of Hauser & Wirth’s Piccadilly gallery, blurring the lines between real and staged scenarios, and questioning the politics of the space and David Cameron’s ‘big society’.\n\nIt was Büchel at his most commentariat, building on a reputation gained early on through the bewildering mazelike installation at Hauser & Wirth’s Coppermill space in 2007, investigating unpalatable sexual activities that might exist beneath the bourgeois veneer by inviting a Viennese swingers club to make its home at the Secession gallery and dissecting sectarian politics during last year’s Glasgow International festival. There are other artists whose practice also concentrates on constructed architecture, but it is surely Büchel’s that risks the most in its near destruction of the division between art\n\nand life.\n\nNovember 2013",

There is a nuanced reflection in her work of the ideological struggle between Islam and the secular world – and her audience, as well as her importance, grow ever steadily: her first feature film, Women Without Men (2009), on the subject of the 1953 Iranian coup, won the Silver Lion at Cannes, and its release coincided with the election protests in that country.\n\nNeshat gave one of the widely seen TED (‘ideas worth spreading’) talks at the end of last year, on the subject of this ‘cry for democracy’ from Iran, and she has been creating a series of seasonal films this year for The New York Times website: Spring and Summer so far, and they have both obliquely focused on the Arab Spring. This month will see Neshat return to Performa, realising a major new commission, Overruled. This courtroom drama, featuring projections and live performers, tackles the subject of female censorship in Iran, and will mark a decade since RoseLee Goldberg commissioned her to make Logic of the Birds for Performa, in 2001.",

So it is that an artist who disdains the artworld can show at a blue-chip commercial gallery (installing something akin to a homeless encampment of tents in view of Hauser & Wirth’s snazzy restaurant); how an artist whose most famous work involved selling snowballs on a New York sidewalk is now recreating in skeletal steel a warehouse that once stood on the Hudson River’s Pier 52. That permanent public artwork dedicated to community broke ground this year with one false note: Warren Kanders, the teargas manufacturer who resigned from the board of the Whitney after protests, is among its funders.",

This last, Better be watching the clouds (notionally a project from the archives of Raad’s fictional Atlas Group, which collects documentary material related to the contemporary history of Lebanon), was a typical expression of Raad’s sensibility, featuring pages from a book of flora native to the Middle East, onto which he had overlaid the portraits of political leaders connected to the Lebanese Civil War. Outside the gallery space, Raad is a prominent activist within the Gulf Labor Artist Coalition, looking out for those building the baubles of the Emirates. Raad’s students at New York’s Cooper Union are getting a vivid demonstration of how art practice and real life can marry. ",

Albeit a very engaging showoff, adept at using and, in turn, abusing the press. His ideological standpoint, which takes Marx via Lacan, is characterised by a myriad of pop-cultural references drawn into an often spittle-infested, tangent-friendly delivery.\n\nThough by no means just an artworld figure – he had a heavyweight bout with Julian Assange this year, for example – Zizek’s interpretation of prevailing twentieth-century philosophy means there are few theory courses or curator’s reading lists that don’t feature the so-called most dangerous philosopher in the West.

            "‘The community is an important component of the gallery’s fabric’, says William Wells, co-owner, with Yasser Gerab, of Cairo’s Townhouse Gallery. Accordingly, the gallery, a hub of four buildings located on a downtown backstreet, is home not only to one of the biggest private exhibition spaces in the Middle East but also a public library, studios and spaces to accommodate a varied programme of performances, workshops and community projects.\n\nWorking with a mix of Arab and international artists, and making up its own rules for what an institution should be, Townhouse has created opportunities for artists from the Arab region to exhibit abroad (in September they collaborated with the Serpentine Gallery in London to present Susan Hefuna’s ‘I Love Egypt’, Speak Out!, a temporary learning camp in Hyde Park), stepped up to become a teaching institution and set about picking apart the idea of art as the object-based product of a privileged author by throwing open the gallery walls to a wide public: in the wake of the Egyptian revolution, Townhouse opened The Popular Show, for which anyone could submit ‘works of art or objects of any medium, nature, quantity, duration or scale’ in response to the ‘exclusivity that is practiced within contemporary art institutions’.",

            "A reentry to the Power 100 for the directors of Artangel, the commissioning agency for (primarily) large-scale public art projects. In this year’s funding announcements from Arts Council England the organisation got a hefty budget increase, up £200k to £754,000. That’s perhaps partly in recognition of a string of successes: Roger Hiorns’s sensationally popular 2009 commission, Seizure, an abandoned South London house in which every surface was covered with blue copper sulphate crystals; the commission of a public soundwork in the City of London in 2010 by Susan Philipsz, which contributed to her Turner Prize win last year; and a clutch of awards for Clio Barnard’s ‘genre-busting’ documentary film The Arbor (2010).\n\nMorris and Lingwood have also furthered Artangel’s ambitions internationally, in cocommissioning the final part of Yael Bartana’s film trilogy, …and Europe Will Be Stunned, for the Polish Pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale and cocommissioning Mike Kelley’s Mobile Homestead – the first public work by the artist – in which a reconstructed version of his childhood home toured the streets of Detroit.",

Through his art and activism (he is involved in the Krytyka Polityczna – Political Critique – movement), the artist has considered and analysed the period of uneasy transition from communism – including a period of martial law – to capitalism during which he grew up.\n\nZmijewski often explores the ways in which social groups psychologically adapt to new conditions, and his discomfiting video works, which include a recreation of the Stanford Prison Experiment and a recording of deaf children singing Bach, have obviously made an impact on the socially engaged, participatory practice of a younger generation of artists including Yael Bartana and Katerina Seda.\n\nThis is an artist with a manifesto, no less – ‘The Applied Social Arts’ – which questions what tangible effects art can have on society or activism, and which will be used as a point of departure for his direction of the 2012 Berlin Biennale, for which he invited open submissions (and received 7,500 of them).",

His programme remains focused on artists from Eastern Europe, among them Attila Csörgö, Vadim Fiškin, Alexander Gutke, the Slovenian collective IRWIN, Dan Perjovschi, Goran Petercol and Tobias Putrih, but also includes young international artists such as Magnus Larsson and Ariel Schlesinger.",

Aside from generating a thriving local arts scene, Tohmé has become an expert at building networks across the Middle East, North Africa and beyond – an invaluable mission in a country struck by ongoing conflict. In addition to its exhibition programme (including a major show of Simone Fattal’s drawings in 2024) and free educational programmes for artists (workshops this year were led by the likes of Haig Aivazian, Marwa Arsanios and Joe Namy), the organisation ran a series of artist-film screenings at Beirut’s Sursock Museum. It was also one of the venues for ‘Why Germany’, an international lecture series reflecting on the recent crackdown on free speech in that country, for which it invited writer and academic Yasmeen Daher to consider the evolution of the Palestine solidarity movement. Tohmé’s skills as a cultural organiser are likely to have played a part in her recent appointment as director of the next Istanbul Biennial [https://artreview.com/christine-tohme-to-curate-18th-istanbul-biennial/].",

And she’s just endowed a foundation in her adopted country’s Cáceres with a 2,500-strong collection of, well, you name it: Flavin, Judd, Smithson and a raft of international and Spanish artists working today.\n\nShe’s as likely to buy works off a neighbouring Art Basel stand as to crow about her gallery’s own significant successes, and she has a fiercely loyal following among artists – witness the roll call of contemporary stars who showed up for a weekend of celebrations at her foundation’s opening in June, led by the Serpentine’s Hans Ulrich Obrist and shadowed by the Beyeler Foundation’s Sam Keller.\n\nBut behind all this love and fellow-feeling lies an unshakeable belief in her own taste: ‘I collect with my eyes, not my ears’. And she’s no pushover: Cáceres’s city fathers won’t be getting the bulk of her collection until they commit to a new Mansilla & Tuñon-designed home for it. Just give her the building, we say.",

            "Christian Boros’s roles as art collector (together with partner and adviser Karen) – with their 3,000 sq m private foundation in a former Berlin S&M club – and media magnate collided this year with the cofounding of the Distanz Verlag, an enterprise in which the pair are joined by Uta Grosenick, editor of Taschen’s Art Now book series. No vanity project, the start-up has Angelika Taschen herself coming onboard next year – leaving the company that bears her ex-husband’s family name – and has already issued a catalogue of assiduously designed and manufactured survey and monograph hardcovers. Meanwhile, Lohmann has joined Art Basel as its VIP coordinator in Germany, and the brutal environs of the Berlin gallery, which showcases just some of the couple’s sculpture collection, continues to attract a steady stream of prebooked visitors.",

            "Just as you were the settling in to read last November’s Power 100 issue, Gorvy, the chairman and international head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s auction house, saw his New York saleroom hammer down Francis Bacon’s triptych Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) for $142.4m (£88.3m), the most expensive contemporary artwork ever sold at auction. That figure, along with the current vogue among collectors for paying high prices at auction for new works by very young artists, goes perhaps a little way towards accounting for the fact that sales of contemporary art now account for close to half of all auction business. For Gorvy, it’s booming, and with new collectors flooding in there’s no sign of a bust in sight. In a market like this one, and when your auction house is top of the food chain – Christie’s had record sales of just under £800m in the first six months of 2014, a rise of 20 percent over the same period in 2013 – you’re going to have to move jobs before you’ll be off this list.",

Speaking of the move, Lévy recently stated that she ‘felt that the old, postwar pole of Paris–New York had become Berlin–Los Angeles’. Like many of the galleries that have been able to expand through the recent economic chaos, Lévy and Mnuchin (a former equities trader and director of the New York Stock Exchange) split their operation between the secondary and primary markets, with the LA space their biggest statement yet of an intention to dominate the latter in the way they already dominate the former.",

Continua’s Beijing space opened in 2005. This year, while most dealers were chasing collectors to ex-urban resorts of the rich, Continua took a punt on central Paris (as well as a popup for Anish Kapoor in Dubai). ‘There was sadness’ to the shuttered city, Fiaschi told The Art Newspaper. They opened, he added ‘to generate smiles’, first with a JR-curated exhibition pre-refurb, followed by two group shows. Still undergoing renovation is the controversially privatised Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo, where the gallery staged a small show of Cuban artists in anticipation of opening a space within the complex. Also conflicted is the trio’s operation in Cuba, which some Cuban activists have accused of legitimising the government.",

            "With regional art fairs jockeying for credibility and calendar time, Art Basel stands out for its farsighted move to have long ago expanded its brand beyond its Swiss home, with Art Basel’s Miami Beach celebrating its tenth anniversary in December this year. Codirectors since 2008, ex-journalist Spiegler and manager Schönholzer’s energetic leadership has seen Art Basel’s fairs consolidate their status as the go-to events for European and American collectors, combining an attractive mix of hospitality, talks and artists’ projects to smooth down the raw commercialism. And with its owners having recently acquired a majority stake in Hong Kong’s ART HK fair, Art Basel will be part of an organisation whose reach spans the globe, further concentrating the power of art fairs in the culture of the artworld. Spiegler and Schönholzer must be grinning.",

            "This year, when Fischli/Weiss were awarded the prestigious Wolfgang Hahn Prize at the Museum Ludwig, the jury identified them as ‘among the most influential and perhaps ingenious artists in Switzerland’. Try ‘the world’. The pair’s 30-year, dazzlingly diverse enquiry into how we interpret reality has spawned countless direct and indirect imitations internationally, though few can match Fischli/Weiss’s knife-edge balance of humour and seriousness. Institutions worldwide love them, too: at the time of writing they have overlapping retrospectives in Munich and Kanazawa. Meanwhile, a new work made for the Ludwig – excerpts from live radio edited into a single faux-broadcast that steadily baffles its listeners – suggests they’ve hardly lost their touch vis-à-vis marvelously absurdist hermeneutics.",

            "That Szymczyk’s staging of Documenta 14 across Athens and Kassel divided opinion might have been expected, given the curator’s promise to challenge preconceptions about what the major exhibition could be. Yet controversy shifted into crisis when it emerged late last year that the organisation had overspent by €7m, leading the Kassel branch of Germany’s far-right AfD party to sue Szymczyk and CEO Annette Kulenkampff for mismanaging public funds (they were cleared in August of any wrongdoing). That the exhibition had been politicised was confirmed in October by the removal of Olu Oguibe’s Monument to Strangers and Refugees (2017) from Kassel’s central square by the local government. Szymczyk might have been guilty of overreach, but his radical decentring of the quinquennial – twinned exhibitions complemented by expansive publishing and public programmes exploring indigeneity, antifascism, resistance, identity and marginality – provoked conversations that feel increasingly pressing. Not to mention that his recent travails reveal the upped stakes in the European culture wars. His next move is attended with interest.",

For critic Peter Schjeldahl, West’s exploration of audience interaction in his work of the 1970s and 80s ‘anticipated – and considerably outshines – the recent vogue for “relational aesthetics”’, while artists such as Rachel Harrison, Sarah Lucas and Paul McCarthy are quick to acknowledge the Austrian’s influence.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, West’s first European retrospective opened at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, before going on to Naples and Graz. By the end of it he’d also racked up solo shows at Almine Rech in Brussels and Gagosian in Rome as well as producing a new work for the Liverpool Biennial and the Hayward Gallery’s New Décor summer show.",

She has established herself as a major collector, increasingly internationally, with an eye (helped by a curatorial team) for what fits with her and husband Poju’s London-based private institution (together with a space on Broadway in New York and a residency programme on an island in Poju’s native Finland). In September Anita told The New York Times, ‘We prefer artists who like to work on longterm projects with institutions. The get-richquick painters are another story.’ So no ‘crapstraction’, then. This policy is borne out in their shows over the past year, including Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch (on now), Michael E. Smith, Adriano Costa, Heather Phillipson and, from an older generation, Albert Oehlen. Over in Finland hotshots Caragh Thuring, Sam Falls and Nicolas Deshayes holed up on the island to make work, as various vIps stopped by to take a peek.   ",

Mobile Homestead (2010), an ambitious public project that will see a replica of his childhood home make a journey from midtown Detroit to the suburbs where Kelley grew up, is the artist’s first public project anywhere in the world to result in a permanent installation. It’s proof of his continuing ability to remain on the perceived fringes while creating work that is undeniably significant, and which has a wide and lasting influence.",

Throughout turbulent financial times, and as its LA neighbours peaked and troughed, the Hammer has stayed solvent.\n\nThe big news this year, however, is the Hammer’s recently announced founding, in partnership with LAXART, of a Los Angeles Biennial, which will begin in 2012 and feature artists from the city and surrounding areas in institutional and found spaces. (Given this supportive emphasis, it’s unsurprising that Philbin describes the Hammer’s primary audience as artists.) Though region-based selections may have their problems, in a period in which there are fears about the homogenisation of the LA museums (due to the growing powers of Eli Broad and MOCA), the Hammer and LAXART will help to guarantee a strong home–city scene.",

Then there will be two museums, the one dedicated to contemporary art, designed by Beirut-born Lina Ghotmeh, developed in a deal inked this year with the Pompidou (the second institution, the Museum of the Incense Road, is dedicated to ancient trading routes). Blazwick is already buying work by the likes of Yayoi Kusama, Carmen Herrera, Etel Adnan and Ibrahim El Salahi for the walls and floors. Not without controversy, Blazwick also pipped Defne Ayas to be curator [https://artreview.com/iwona-blazwick-to-curate-istanbul-biennial-2024/] of the 2024 Istanbul Biennial, against the advice [https://artreview.com/istanbul-biennial-needs-greater-transparency-now-iwona-blazwick-defne-ayas-iksv/] of the nonbinding independent selection committee (on which she originally sat).",

And it’s really hard to imagine that they could not have expected the pasting the design got from public and critics alike.\n\nKapoor’s last foray into architecture, a train station with Future Systems in Naples, has only been completed this year, two years later than planned, but there’ll be no chance of lateness in London, with an Olympic deadline looming. And there’s no doubting Kapoor’s popularity: in addition to a solo show at the Guggenheim Bilbao, his Royal Academy exhibition (the first granted to a living British artist) got 277,473 visitors, making it into the top three of London contemporary art shows last year. It’s a pulling power that few of his peers can match.",

Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes. \n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there’s Slotover’s influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city’s East End.",

And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

As the former member of the Italian Communist Party told Vogue this year, family takes up another third, while the rest of her time is devoted to ‘culture and the Fondazione’. The Venice-and-Milan-based private institution is no trinket (with Tokyo and Shanghai project spaces), and Prada is very hands-on, telling Vogue how she struggled to find a curator who would fully embrace her vision of a future show on feminism. She did, however, get the likes of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler to curate Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Technology and Power, 1500–2025, a Marx-tinged show on tech and power that closed in January; while Meriem Bennani installed a solo exhibition in Milan, Christoph Büchel [https://artreview.com/christoph-buchel-monte-di-pieta-fondazione-prada-venice-biennale/] in Venice, Michaël Borremans in China and Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin in Japan.",

            "Few museum appointments can have produced as much debate as the hiring of longtime New York gallerist and art impresario Deitch to the top position at LA MOCA. Why the surprise? If your entire art career has been about serving the interests of a particular group of artists and a particular group of collectors, can you really acquire overnight the disinterest that most people expect a museum director to pretend to have? But as those groups include the kind of people he’ll be asking to donate money to his new institution, there’s a certain logic to it all.\n\nDeitch’s energetic presence and savvy (an attentiongrabbing collaboration with actor James Franco, for example) are probably what the ailing MOCA needs right now: nearbankrupt after financial mismanagement and the credit-crunch caught up with it, MOCA was bailed out by a $30m donation plan from billionaire MOCA trustee Eli Broad.\n\nDeitch’s appointment probably won’t appease those who worry that Broad is too dominant on the LA art scene, or the artists who wonder why this museum director is hanging out with actors instead of seeing what’s happening in their studios, but when you’re on your knees, it’s hard to be too demanding. If Deitch makes a success of this, it may become a model other museums will want to follow.",

Which means numerous exhibitions: at L&M Arts in New York, Gagosian in New York, Galería Hilario Galguera in New Mexico and Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum. This last retrospective not only found Hirst partying with Albert II, the principality’s crown prince; it also included spot, spin and butterfly paintings, all series which, he announced at the Gagosian show (entitled End of an Era), he would no longer be producing.\n\nThis may to some extent slow the shrinking of Hirst’s market – down by 93 percent last year and bound to be lower this annum – and allay the artist’s detractors, who in August reiterated and expanded on accusations of plagiarism. A charge Hirst branded ‘gibberish’. Still, Hirst isn’t one for cooling his heels. His Murderme art collection grows apace, his Other Criteria publishing wing and retail outlets continue to turn out books, sell multiples and support exhibitions – and he’s rumoured to have a longterm gig booked in: a Tate retrospective to coincide with London’s 2012 Olympics. ",

Still, a routine year for Enwezor nevertheless involved Performa’s annual gala being dedicated to him; officially this was for his catalytic role in raising the visibility of South African art, though the visibility of art from all of Africa and the diaspora would, surely, be very different without Enwezor’s evangelising over the 20 years since his first major curatorial project. Meanwhile, the typically ambitious programme he oversees at Munich’s Haus der Kunst included major monographic shows (James Casebere, Michael Buthe and an upcoming one by Joana Hadjithomas & Khalil Joreige), and the whopping global survey Postwar – Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic 1945–65. In January he signed on for another five years at HDK: a no-brainer on its part, though Enwezor will no doubt pop up in many other places too. ",

Broad (together with wife Edythe) wants to be the art angel in the City of Angels, creating press and fanfare whenever he gives. And give he undeniably does.\n\nThere are fears being voiced from LA’s art community that Broad is having a significant homogenising influence on the city’s museums. Press coverage of Broad is filled with sideswipes and barely concealed irritation on the part of patrons, curators and museum directors (except those he supports or those waiting for a cheque).\n\nThe truth is, however, that museums need Broad like never before: California has a 12 percent unemployment rate and a $20b deficit, and financial cuts are being made left, right and centre. Broad, with a fortune valued at $5.7b, has pledged to give 75 percent of it away. And the building of the Broad collection museum on Grand Avenue, designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which is now getting under way in earnest, should keep him busy for the time being.",

And other gallery artists continue to maintain a high profile. \n\nElmgreen & Dragset’s exhibitions in 2013 have included a yearlong public project in Munich’s main squares and a major site-specific installation in the old textile galleries at the V&A in London. Meanwhile the ever-popular and populist Grayson Perry becomes the first visual artist to deliver the BBC’s annual Reith Lectures. The recent addition of Kara Walker to the gallery’s roster won’t do any harm either. ",

Curated by the gallerist and Francesco Bonami, the exhibition, like the architecture housing it, sought to ‘fuse elements of historicism with modernity’. Yan was the subject of a solo show at De Carlo’s second Milanese gallery in September, while fellow painter Jamian Juliano-Villani (pictures of Amy Winehouse, goats wearing Ugg boots, a dog waving a knife), took over the London space over the summer. She was followed by the more minimal, abstract canvases of McArthur Binion (who also exhibited, earlier this year, in De Carlo’s Hong Kong gallery), described by the Financial Times as ‘some of the finest and most thoughtprovoking contemporary paintings to be seen in Europe right now’.",

            "In the words of Emmett Brown, another wild, white-haired visionary: ‘Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads.’ But roads certainly help if, like billionaire mining magnate Paz, you want to bring people to see your 5,000-acre botanic garden and sculpture park (neither of which terms really do justice to Inhotim, his vast playground of exhibition pavilions and large-scale installations, overseen by curator Rodrigo Moura and advised by Allan Schwartzman). Because now that the truly dedicated art pilgrims (not to mention the people from underprivileged local communities who also visit) have already flown to Belo Horizonte in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, and taken the 90-minute, mostly dirt-track drive, Paz is after the rest of us. Roads will help, as will the hotels, theatre and convention centre that Paz says he is also planning. Whether all this development will spoil Inhotim’s mystique remains to be seen.   ",

            "Confident enough that their website is blank apart from an email address, Neuger and Riemschneider are a cornerstone of the Berlin gallery scene: from 1994 onwards, they were instrumental in breaking barely known artists such as Rirkrit Tiravanija, Olafur Eliasson, Tobias Rehberger and Michel Majerus. This year marks 20 years since they moved to their Mitte headquarters, and 25 since they began working with Jorge Pardo, an anniversary celebrated by a recent show. Elsewhere in the programme were thoughtful group shows on negation and the construction of selfhood, a loopily cerebral Mario García Torres exhibition involving an animatronic tortoise and performances by Austrian screen legend Helmut Berger, a stormily politicised James Benning presentation and, demonstrating that Neuger and Riemschneider won’t be pinned down, a display of paintings by Billy Childish.  ",

He celebrated – how else? – with a show of Beuys’s works on paper at his London gallery at the start of the year, and another at Ropac’s Seoul branch at the end of the year. Having opened in Salzburg in 1983, and adding two London and two Paris spaces along the way, Ropac landed in South Korea in 2021 and this year doubled the square meterage there by adding another floor, allowing for a simultaneous exhibition of Donald Judd’s sculptures and paintings in September. As well as some of the great American estates, Ropac has become the de facto rep for canonical artists of the German-speaking world, among them VALIE EXPORT, Anselm Kiefer, Not Vital and Imi Knoebel. Georg Baselitz turned eighty-five this year, so there were more celebrations to arrange, with shows staged by the painter at nine institutions around the world, including at London’s Serpentine galleries and Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich.",

Picking up the bill to the glam event – a fundraiser for the long-running New York performance biennial – was Chang, the founder of the Beijing-based Domus Collection (and collector of Johnson’s work). Live art is an expensive business, with little in the way of a market to help it along, and Chang, as president of Performa’s board, has been a major backer. Yet it’s not just cutting-edge work that attracts Chang: he’s a (heavily involved) trustee at the Royal Academy in London, as well as vice chair of the International Council at Tate. Of course this is just the public face of Chang’s patronage. As an avid collector, he is searching out, he once told ArtReview, works that have ‘truth and beauty’; when Chang favours an artist, he becomes a supporter in more ways than one.",

Extract Kortun from this picture, however, and it’d likely look very different. Curator, writer, teacher, director of nonprofit gallery and research centre SALT, and go-to sounding board and mediator for the Turkish art scene (see his insider commentary during the Gezi Park protests and supportive intervention in last year’s troubled biennial), he’s been – and remains – inestimably important in the infrastructural growth of a city which, as next year’s Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev-directed Istanbul Biennial gathers pace, will only receive more attention.  ",

Murakami’s personal career is still flourishing: two solo gallery shows (in Hong Kong and LA) and one institutional show, Takashi in Superflat Wonderland, at Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul. His debut feature film, Jellyfish Eyes (2013), had its international premiere in April. And the Japanese makeup brand Shu Uemura has announced a cosmetics collection, titled Six Hearts Princes, based on Murakami’s 6HP anime project.",

In September the achingly hip Anne Imhof had a show in Berlin; in February Heji Shin showed her portraits of Kanye West (fresh from their outing earlier this year at Kunsthalle Zürich). The cool middle-aged people were represented there, too: an exhibition of Michael Krebber’s austere works in May ‘still managed to piss people off’, reported Artforum. But it was a dead cool person who really stole the limelight in 2019. In the early 1950s, Andy Warhol collaborated with author Ralph Thomas (‘Corkie’) Ward on a series of self-published books. The first of these, A Is an Alphabet, a collection of 26 loose pages that feature Warhol’s cute illustrations and Ward’s weird rhymes – ‘a surreal, horny fairytale’, as Interview succinctly described it – went on show in Berlin before travelling to New York.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

Though his business includes the German art magazine Monopol and JRP Ringier, the art book publisher whose recent output ranges from the Art Basel catalogue to artist Scott King’s graphic novel, it’s not for these that our man is included here. Ringier is an avid collector and all-round art fan. More than 200 works populate the publisher’s Zürich headquarters, and artists have been commissioned to design the company’s annual report since 1997 (last year it was Laura Owens). More of Ringier’s personal collection is made available to Pool, a programme that gives an emerging curator time with both Ringier’s and Maja Hoffmann’s art. This year Arthur Fink was the appointed fellow, staging a show at Luma / Westbau, Zürich.",

By contrast, London sales throughout the year proved strong, if not earth-shattering, but for Westphal – chairman of contemporary art Europe – the auction game may be changing anyway: in October, Sotheby’s expanded its S/2 private sales gallery format from New York to London, effectively muscling in on the business of gallerists and private dealers.\n\nPrivate sales are a growth area for Sotheby’s, so S/2 London plans five selling shows a year. Sotheby’s shareholders seem to like it: the company’s shares have risen continuously, even while billionaire activist investor Dan Loeb has recently been gunning for Sotheby’s CEO William Ruprecht to step down.",

Back at the two Glasgow spaces Webster calls home, an exhibition exchange with Standard in Oslo was announced. The Modern Institute will reciprocate in due course, before planning subsequent exchanges with other international galleries. \n\nWith its stable of artists largely consisting of the gallerist’s generational peers – Simon Starling (whose epic CGI video commission has been on show at Tate Britain all year), Urs Fischer (everywhere), Jim Lambie and Cathy Wilkes among them – Webster’s gallery is small enough to be able to instigate such deft manoeuvres, but big enough and respected enough to have the endeavour noticed and cheered on.",

A tricky moment arrived when over 100 artists and intellectuals, including Lucy Lippard and Walid Raad, signed a petition calling for artists to withdraw from ‘Living as Form’, a Creative Time exhibition put together by the organisation’s influential chief curator, Nato Thompson, which toured to the Technion in Israel, a university and research centre connected to military technologies then being used to bomb Palestine. Black Radical Brooklyn, four projects set around Weeksville, a community centre in Brooklyn, met with a warm reception, however, highlighting an important history while creating artist-led community projects.  ",

King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‘Artists… like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.’ His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who’s who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks’s skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive. ",

            "Back in 2005 the collector and philanthropist declared, ‘I don’t want to be in-name-only for committees’. Nine years later there is more than enough evidence to suggest she stands by this vow. ‘Aggie’ Gund doesn’t just dash into MoMA once in a while to fulfil her role as its president emerita or as chairman of MoMA PS1; she gets involved. In September she even appeared on PS1 director Klaus Biensenbach’s Instagram feed doing stretches in preparation for a rehearsal of a Xavier Le Roy performance (the artist currently has a show at PS1). Besides MoMA, Gund chairs the Mayor of New York’s Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, is founder of the Studio in a School Association, is on the board of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and is honorary trustee of Independent Curators International and, in her hometown of Cleveland, of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art. She collects, she donates, she’s irrepressible. ",

Times change, but Gillick keeps his eye trained on the intersection of aesthetics and capital, as he has done for the past two decades. While his output ranges from architectural installation to sculpture, his videoworks took centre stage at the Madre Museum in Naples this summer. If his work affects the corporate aesthetic – his exhibition at Maureen Paley, London, in September consisted of slick architectural interventions and more films – then visitors to Kunsthalle Wien in July would have been reassured that Gillick puts his heart and soul into his work, as they witnessed the production of a feature film he is making with Austrian collective Gelitin. He is equally influential behind closed doors, sitting on the steering committee of Maja Hoffmann’s Luma Foundation. With such consistent success, Gillick’s blue Mondays should be few and far between.",

There was a solo show at New York’s Gladstone Gallery at the end of last year, another at the Paris gallery space of rebooted journal Cahiers d’Art and a survey of ceramic works from the past decade of her thirty-year career at the rebooted Aspen Art Museum. And, of course, her work featured in a number of group shows, among them the Gwangju Biennale. Featuring a wide range of media – sculpture, video, drawing, textiles to name but a few – Trockel’s oeuvre is notoriously hard to pin down, but that didn’t stop her picking up the CHF 150,000 Roswitha Haftmann Prize, the biggest in Europe, in recognition of both the importance of her extraordinary artistic output and the influence she exerts on younger artists, in part through 16 years of teaching in her role as Professor of Sculpture at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.   ",

The issuing of the seventh edition this year was notably delayed, not once but twice, due to Russia’s invasion. In October, however, the winner was finally announced: Bangladeshi artist Ashfika Rahman, chosen from a shortlist of 21 by a big-name jury that included Cecilia Alemani [https://artreview.com/artist/cecilia-alemani/] and Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung [https://artreview.com/artist/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung/]. Pinchuk, who Donald Trump once called ‘a very, very special man’ (and who hired Kellyanne Conway, an official in the 45th president’s administration, as his lobbyist this year), bankrolled a vast exhibition during the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] titled From Ukraine: Dare to Dream, in which artists ranging from Shilpa Gupta to Nikita Kadan to Otobong Nkanga [https://artreview.com/artist/otobong-nkanga-2/] reflected on what the curators described as ‘an ongoing power struggle’, while ‘storms and climate change ravage lands far and wide’ and ‘political extremes are seizing their growing momentum’. For Pinchuk, then, art undoubtedly has geopolitical purchase.",

            "Following on from several years of more hard-hitting, London-focused film projects – including the 2020 Small Axe series of five films that charted the lives of West Indian immigrants to the city, codirecting the documentary Uprising (2021) on a 1981 fire in South London, and his filmic monument Grenfell [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-will-not-look-away-serpentine-gallery-london/] (2023), a single-shot circling of the site of the tragic 2017 apartment block fire – the gap between McQueen’s art and cinema projects feels wider of late. This year, McQueen received a solo exhibition that continues to occupy both Dia sites in New York, with several film works and a new photographic series on display in the institution’s Chelsea space, and in a massive former factory site Beacon is his new installation Bass, the basement space filled only with coloured lighting and reverberating with snatches of music (The music an extended jam session, recorded in-situ, between different forms of the titular instrument, played by a stellar ensemble that included Meshell Ndegeochello and jazz veteran Marcus Miller.) The show received widespread acclaim, and will travel to Switzerland’s Schaulager next year. He also released the documentary Occupied City [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-review/], in which he slowly traced and filmed all the locations that appear in author, historian and producer (and McQueen’s wife) Bianca Stigter’s book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940–1945 (2019). Offering a meditative study of the Dutch capital under the Nazis, it was a cinematic tour de force that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.\n\nSo far, so auteur. McQueen’s second celluloid outing this year, Blitz, however, which opened to mixed reviews, demonstrated how mainstream he can go. Telling the story of a young boy during the World War II bombing of London, it was ‘an old-fashioned children’s adventure movie, a rollicking yarn that might have been on television on a Bank Holiday afternoon’, thought the BBC. ‘Shockingly conventional’, Variety noted. But McQueen seems confident straddling both documentary and fiction forms, as well as arthouse and (attempted) blockbuster modes, and continues to serve as a model to artists who might want to make work that can occupy the gallery, the cinema, as well as home streaming platforms.",

That loss is not always a bad thing was perhaps the message of Brian Belott, the self-proclaimed ‘Master of Discard’, who closed the gallery with his thrift-store assemblages. Nor is Brown likely to mope: he had four artists in the international exhibition at the Venice Biennale – Ed Atkins, Frida Orupabo, Avery Singer and Golden Lion winner Arthur Jafa – with Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys representing Belgium. There were also shows for Alex Katz and Ella Kruglyanskaya in his Harlem space and Charlemagne Palestine and Laura Owens at his Rome outpost, while Karl Holmqvist joined the restaurant/gallery that Brown and Rirkrit Tiravanija run in upstate New York. This autumn there was a trip to Paris to stage a show at Galerie Patrick Seguin.",

Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

After 46 years, Lisson is still an artworld cuckoo in the unhipsterish nest of Edgware Road, but this unlikely ’hood is the London home to Nicholas Logsdail’s multigenerational family of artists. This last year, weapon-mangling Pedro Reyes and claymation heroes Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg have also been welcomed into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile Lisson’s senior artists continue to assert themselves on a global scale – Ai Weiwei and Anish Kapoor have had significant international exhibitions and Marina Abramović has been, well, everywhere. After opening its first international space in Milan two years ago, Lisson recently set up a by-appointment office in New York: rumour has it that a full stateside gallery is soon to follow.",

As chairman and CEO of luxury group LVMH, a little bit of his Bloomberg-estimated $97.3bn fortune goes to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. This year the private museum gave over its galleries to Gilbert & George, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Courtauld’s hallowed collection of Impressionism. The foundation’s smaller ‘espaces’ in Venice and Tokyo, meanwhile, hosted shows by Philippe Parreno and Christian Boltanski respectively. Yet it was an even more spectacular brand of philanthropy that put Arnault and his family in the spotlight this year, after they publicly announced a €200m donation to Notre-Dame while the cathedral was still smouldering (conveniently overshadowing the €100m earlier pledged by his nemesis François Pinault). Sceptics suggested that Arnault would benefit from a tax break (he says not), and sniping over this and other megadonations was only partially quelled when, in September, they were eventually signed off.",

            "The gallerists swelled their 43-strong roster with an additional four artists and an estate this year. This last was Robert Colescott, whose paintings, which Blum & Poe hung at their Los Angeles gallery in March, combined surrealism with satire to comment on the state of race politics. Also joining the gallery was young West Coaster Mimi Lauter, who had a show in May, Chicago-based Tony Lewis, Brazilian Solange Pessoa and Japan’s Tomoo Gokita. The gallery has had a presence in Gokita’s hometown of Tokyo since 2014, and it was there, in June, that it showed Agnès Varda. The New Wave filmmaker is undergoing something of a renaissance (and, in collaborations with JR, being embraced by the artworld). That the boys are championing an older artist proves something of a theme: they also gave octogenarian sculptor Wendell Dayton his first major solo show.",

But Gladstone’s artists are often witty commentators on such tensions. Serve the Dominant Ideology or Stop Being a Pussy, Frances Stark’s first exhibition with the gallery since her old home, Gavin Brown’s enterprise, folded into Gladstone in 2020, opened in June and featured 12 paintings of open books. Another astute commentator on the artworld, artist David Salle, and the lucrative estate of Robert Rauschenberg also joined the gallery’s roster this year. With locations in New York, Brussels and Seoul [https://artreview.com/gladstone-gallery-to-open-new-seoul-space/], and artists ranging from Matthew Barney [https://artreview.com/matthew-barney-secondary-no-pain-no-gain/] to Marisa Merz and Rachel Rose (all of whom had shows), as well as the likes of Rirkrit Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] and Sarah Lucas (who have had significant shows elsewhere this year), Gladstone has colossal spread.

This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

Her holdings, concentrating on art from Latin America, are constantly on loan, as well as increasingly being gifted directly to institutions. For example, the Reina Sofía in Madrid was given 45 works by 33 artists (all made since 1990) in March from the Phelps de Cisneros collection, a bequest that followed another donation of 202 works in January to Reína Sofia, MoMA and five other international museums. Hers is a name worth remembering for independent curators and scholars, too: Phelps de Cisneros is the purse behind various residencies and research fellowships, including the Independent Curators International’s annual travel grant.",

He will be its third director in eight years when he takes up the position in 2019. Biesenbach is not the stereotypical ‘safe pair of hands’, but while some of his exhibitions in New York have failed to garner critical acclaim, this is countered by lauded shows such as this year’s Cathy Wilkes solo at PS1, and his habit of championing artists the rest of us are yet to cotton on to. And there is no doubt he has the skills to steady the ship. Biesenbach knows that where he goes, attention is paid. The only blip this year came with a lawsuit issued by curator Nikki Columbus alleging that MoMA PS1 had offered her a curatorial position, only to rescind the offer when it found out that she was pregnant.",

Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

She ‘drafts’ shows like a draughtswoman, she says; ‘you curate pork to make prosciutto’. Either way, there was no filler this year at Turin’s Castello di Rivoli, of which she is director, and Cerruti Villa, which put its $600m collection of modern art on display for the first time. The former hosted exhibitions by artist Michael Rakowitz and Anri Sala. Yet the bulk of Christov-Bakargiev’s energy has this year been devoted to preparing the Cerruti collection – amassed by entrepreneur Francesco Federico Cerruti from the late 1960s to 2014 – for its big public reveal in April. Through a body of work ranging from Francisco de Goya’s The Disasters of War (1863) to Medardo Rosso’s The Jewish Child (1892), as well as more recent paintings by Francis Bacon, Alberto Burri and Pablo Picasso, the collection didn’t need much hyping.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

At the end of 2018, the forthcoming Whitney Biennial – at the museum he’s directed since 2003 – became a flashpoint for controversy when employees demanded the removal of board member Warren B. Kanders over his involvement with teargas manufacturer Safariland. This after the 2017 biennial had been embroiled in a war of words over its inclusion of a painting accused of sensationalising racist violence. This time around, Weinberg dithered, artists quit the biennial and Kanders eventually resigned. One sensed damage-control when, in September, the institution broke ground on David Hammons’s monumental public project Day’s End and Weinberg described the installation as representing ‘our commitment to community and civic good’. Meanwhile, the Whitney continued to settle into its downtown home, with a big Warhol retrospective and an emphasis on shows for artists of colour (Pope.L, Kevin Beasley, Derek Fordjour). How much reputational damage the biennial hullabaloo has caused in the long term remains to be seen.",

            "As any Richter historian will tell you: trying to pinpoint a sense of style to the artist’s work is a task doomed to failure. For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter’s subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‘signature’ aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‘cult of personality’ he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‘It’s a frightening development,’ he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales – Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m – it’s been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman’s New York space in May). But his influence on painting globally remains big.  ",

She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

By any yardstick, Sherman is pretty close to the top of the tree: number five this year on the major-exhibition-derived Kunstkompass rankings; number ten on the list of most expensive living American artists; number three on the list of most expensive living female artists. \n\nAuction prices are, of course, a dismal barometer of merit – so how about popular status? Sherman’s is such that one fan issued a free set of emojis, allowing Cindyphiles to communicate in her image. As for legacy, the Pictures Generation is now looked to as the spiritual forebear of the post-Internet generation as it grapples with a sea of rapidly proliferating, authorless images, the lack of disconnect between advertising and selfexpression, and the increasing commodification of self-image. Sherman has become an informal patron saint to every artist attempting to undermine the selfie or turn Instagram to her own purposes. If anyone can smash that glass ceiling, she’ll be the one to do it.",

            "Are you a curator who wants to do a show with Marina Abramović? Fancy the visitor figures a celebrity artist can bring? (Her 2010 MoMA show was the most popular in the institution’s history, with 850,000 visitors, a number not quite matched by this year’s solos at Bundeskunsthalle, Bonn; Palazzo Strozzi, Florence; Sean Kelly, New York; and Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna, but boons for those spaces nonetheless.) Well get in the queue, because the performance artist’s exhibition schedule is booked to 2024. Abramović is famous enough to be lampooned by Cate Blanchett in a forthcoming Netflix comedy (‘Waiting for the Artist’, an episode of the Documentary Now! series screening next year) and attacked by an artist (a man smashed a portrait of Abramović over the artist’s head in September). Nor does the artist need to be present to make herself felt: the Marina Abramović Institute is increasingly active, staging, for example, eight performances by artists using her ‘method’ at this year’s Bangkok Art Biennale.",

A serial biennial curator, who also hops nimbly between the worlds of public institutions and private foundations, Gioni is artistic director of the Beatrice Trussardi Foundation in his native Italy and the curator of Dark Light: Realism in the Age of Post-Truth at the Aïshti Foundation in Beirut, which featured over 200 works from the collection of Tony and Elham Salamé and focused on the changing meanings of figuration in contemporary art. Proving he can also nip between the worlds of fashion and art, in Doha he is the cocurator of the current Valentino show, Forever Valentino, and, earlier this year, the Jeff Koons survey Lost in America.",

Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

            "It has turned into a tough year for Ruf, who just resigned from her position as director of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, in the midst of alleged conflicts of interest between her institutional role and her broader activities as an adviser. While the effects of that remain to be seen, she nevertheless managed to develop a programme at the Stedelijk that navigates seamlessly between her usual focus on art’s next hot young thing and reexaminations of work by more mature practitioners, as recent shows for Jana Euler and Jordan Wolfson, but also Jean Tinguely and Ed van der Elsken, demonstrate. Furthermore, Ruf’s strength has always been her ability to operate as a meta-curator, in various advisory and panellist roles. In January, she launched the first Verbier Art Summit around the question of whether museums should consider ‘de-growth’, and she continues to be one of the core advisers\u2028to Luma Arles.",

            "It has been a turbulent 12 months since the head of the four Tate galleries took the number one spot on this list. While discontent and protest ﬁtfully surfaced from the activist-left over BP’s corporate sponsorship, in the spring it was Serota’s detractors on the right who made the most noise. The conservative press gleefully stretched for Oscar Wilde clichés when Tate lost not one but two directors in quick succession. Was it carelessness on Serota’s part? Perhaps not, but Penelope Curtis leaving Tate Britain for Calouste Gulbenkian Museum after a much maligned ﬁve-year tenure, and Chris Dercon announcing his decision to jump ship from Tate Modern to direct Berlin’s Volksbühne (although he’ll be staying in the post until next summer) was not a good look for Serota. \n\nThe ten-storey extension, which dwarfs Tate Modern’s original building like a super cruiseliner on the Venetian skyline, is proving controversial too. Currently four years behind its original opening date – during which performance spaces in the power station’s old oil tanks, opened to much hype in 2012, have sat idle as construction continues above them – the additional space is still missing £30m of funding, although Serota says he is conﬁdent this will be found before the new launch date of June 2016. Last year’s top spot came in recognition of Tate’s vast international network of global acquisitions committees and internationally active curatorial teams. No change there. Nor has all the construction dented its exhibition programme (Tanks aside) and general popularity with punters: a(nother) record – 7.9 million visits across all four sites in 2014–15, with 5.7 million alone stepping into Tate Modern. But with his legacy projects nearing completion, is the sixty-nine-year-old eyeing retirement in some pleasant corner of Southern England?.  ",

There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
