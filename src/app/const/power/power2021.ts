            "‘We’re all astronauts building on the frontier of money and the frontier of art and the frontier of finance,’ Cameron Winklevoss told Forbes magazine in April. The Olympian Ivy League twins, who in 2004 famously sued Mark Zuckerberg for having stolen their idea for what would end up as Facebook, have become key players in the intersection of cryptocurrency and art. Having amassed a multibillion-dollar fortune by buying bitcoin early, the brothers launched the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange in 2014, which became the first US-licensed exchange for Ether, the Ethereum blockchain currency. In November 2019 the brothers bought NFT auction site Nifty Gateway, which went on to stage record-breaking sales of CryptoPunks and Beeple’s 2020 Collection, and 2021 has seen Nifty dominate sales with its similar ‘curated’ approach to showcasing artists, partnering with Sotheby’s on their $17m auction of NFT favourite Pak in April. But with competition hotting up, Nifty is shifting from this exclusive model to become a more open trading site for this exploding market.",

            "The painter has had a series of disparate collaborations this year. The first, in her home state of Ohio, was with a bunch of teenagers, going through the Cleveland Museum of Art’s archives with them to produce a playful exhibition of her work. The second was sharing equal billing with Vincent van Gogh at a two-person show at the eponymous foundation-space in Arles, where she placed his paintings against a set of vivid, digitally collaged wallpapers. The contrast is telling, from adolescent awkwardness to taking on the prototypical male artist, as Owens’s work makes no distinction between pop and art-historical references, gestures and methods, combining Photoshopped surfaces with acrylic swirls and readily swapping the illusion of surface and depth. As she’s stated, ‘I want to ask what “painting” means and what “craft” means’; and her willingness to confront what image-making means today has made other artists look to Owens to help define what contemporary painting can be.",

Unshackled, Ahmed has become one of the most important voices in feminist and queer-activist discourse, especially when it involves exposing hypocrisy within supposedly liberal, progressive institutions. This year, publication of The Feminist Killjoy Handbook offered a practical guide to rocking the boat, which includes ‘being willing to confront institutional problems… and to challenge how [institutions] use our efforts to change them as evidence they have changed’. She has been supporting the book with a lecture tour of university campuses in the US and elsewhere. Her messages, such as ‘I like to call diversity practitioners institutional plumbers’ – offering temporary fixes that are in turn claimed and trumpeted loudly by management – have resonated in the staffrooms of museums and galleries internationally.",

With Facebook Inc rebranded as ‘Meta’, the company’s focus is now on a social internet merging virtual reality, entertainment, culture, gaming, digital commerce and, of course, virtual goods – with NFTs as a part of this brave new online world – while the company spent a reported $10bn on its VR development arm, Reality Labs.

His day-job at Centro Cultural São Paulo is just part of that platform. Beyond the institution’s annual open-call exhibition and an online show for Jota Mombaça, Menezes curated an acclaimed survey of the memorialist Carolina Maria de Jesus at Instituto Moreira Salles and appeared on numerous juries and panel discussions. It’s a reputation grown out of Afro-Atlantic Histories which he co-curated across Museu de Arte de São Paulo and the Instituto Tomie Ohtake in 2018, a survey of over 450 works tracing Black-Brazilian culture. That exhibition travelled to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, in October and will continue to the National Gallery of Art, Washington dc next year.",

            "The ubiquitous artist-photographer, known for his monumental black- and-white photomurals that often bring to the fore the unseen faces that make up communities around the world, this year released Paper & Glue, a ‘making of ’ documentary revisiting some of his most ambitious projects at sites including the US–Mexico border, the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and a California supermax prison. But JR is not one to dwell on the past or get slowed down by a global pandemic, instead he completed trompe-l’œil installations in Paris, Florence, and at Egypt’s Great Pyramids, the last a part of an unprecedented exhibition across the Unesco World Heritage Site. Meanwhile the Frenchman has been successfully navigating the artworld: this year staging solo shows at Perrotin, Tokyo; London’s Saatchi and Pace galleries; the Groninger Museum; and curating Truc à Faire, the inaugural show at Galleria Continua’s new Paris space. In between all that he also had time for a pre-Met Gala collaboration with Timothée Chalamet, while Kourtrajmé, the free art and cinema school he coruns in Paris opened its third outpost in Dakar this January.",

Meanwhile, similarly animated lizards, which featured in 2 Lizards, a series of Instagram shorts that brought her even more fame during the COVID-19 lockdowns, went on show at the Whitney in New York, while beyond the museum walls Bennani had a High Line commission to deal with, installing a 2.7m-high motorised foam sculpture of a tornado on the city’s elevated park.",

It would be useful for the artist if she could replicate herself IRL, given her exhausting schedule this year. Winning the Future Fields Commission, she presented a new work at Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin, which then moved to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. That was after having closed two museum solo shows at Bergen Kunsthall, in January, and Fridericianum, Kassel, in February, and before opening another two at MCA Chicago and Hessel Museum of Art at Bard, New York. The latter is timed with her first foray into feature film (to be streamed on Mubi), The African Desperate, a satire of the artworld, and of art education, set at Bard and starring Bridget Donahue, Syms’s New York gallerist, and artist A. L. Steiner, her former teacher, as her fictional professors.\n\n",

Her work was included this year in the triennial Prospect 5 in New Orleans, as well as a solo show now reopened at MoCA Los Angeles. Most prominently, though, was her substantial retrospective, which opened at the Serpentine Gallery in London in May, and toured to the Whitney Museum in New York in October. Common among the works included were aspects of friendship, memory and grief, though they also retained an ambivalent distance from the sitters, as if not wanting to pry. ‘I have access to surface, and to social dynamics,’ Packer has said. Among those artists painting the Black body, Packer’s work provides a quiet reordering of what we can see in portraiture.",

The founder and director of African Artists’ Foundation, the 16-year-old nonprofit arts organisation, and Lagos Photo Festival has been preoccupied with questions of survival: in 2020 the foundation was evicted from its base by its landlords, unfairly it claims, which has put its activities on hiatus.

This included artefacts of American pop culture, Arabic literature, punk cinema, childhood drawings and photographs relating to the artist’s childhood, spent between Washington State and the Middle East. The show also featured her trilogy Beast Type Song (2019), which was the subject of a solo at Turku Art Museum in Finland; Tender Point Ruin (2021); and Tiger Strike Red (2022), lo-fi sci-fi works that present possible futures haunted by imperialist pasts, dystopias threaded through with the hope of what she has called ‘counter-histories’. As the Emirates increases its footprint in the arts, Al-Maria has emerged as one of the region’s most prescient voices. Her interest in future ruins was evident too in the video she made for Miu Miu and the Italian fashion house’s Spring/Summer 2024 runway show.",

            "One criterion for entry onto this list is influence on the public perception of what art is. This influence is sometimes indirect – as in the thinkers whose ideas shape the art that the public encounters in museums – and sometimes direct. KAWS, the Brooklyn-based artist also known as Brian Donnelly, belongs in the latter camp. Starting out as an animator by day and street artist by night, he has, in the past 20 years, achieved a level of brand recognition through commercial partnerships and celebrity supporters that few in the field can match. That brand takes the ubiquitous symbols of commercialised capitalism, most notably Mickey Mouse, and subverts them in a manner too vague to qualify as either critique or celebration. Kid Cudi’s arrival at the Met Gala wearing a KAWS-designed necklace valued at $1m was typical of the artist’s ability to generate buzz, but it is this year’s retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum that suggests his influence on culture might be longer-lasting than many had thought, or hoped.",

For Cuban artists like Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara and Hamlet Lavastida, their repression at the hands of the state has catalysed collective action. When in 2018 the authorities in Havana announced a new law designed to silence artists, Decree 349, Alcántara became the figurehead of the San Isidro Movement, named after a neighbourhood of the city. For this he has been repeatedly persecuted, and having been on hunger strike [https://artreview.com/cuban-artist-luis-manuel-otero-alcantara-forced-into-hospital-after-hunger-strike/] in prison without trial, this year he was sentenced to five years [https://artreview.com/cuban-artist-jailed-for-five-years-over-decree-349/] for the crime of ‘insulting national symbols’. The prosecution cited a series of Alcántara’s artworks featuring the county’s flag. While Alcántara is one of more than 700 people currently imprisoned over the four-year-old protest, Lavastida, a member of the 27N collective, is one of the many more now living outside the country, winning an Index on Censorship Freedom of Expression Award.",

There are few institutions on this list, but Beckwith’s tenure at her previous institution became synonymous with a diverse and intellectually rigorous programme, symbolised not least by the 2018 Howardena Pindell exhibition, which brought the late African-American artist canonical status. Likewise, in January, Beckwith was one of several curators who helped realise Grief and Grievance: Art and Mourning in America, an exhibition originally conceived by the late Okwui Enwezor, which opened at the New Museum, New York. In an interview for Artnet she posed the questions, ‘How can we possibly imagine how art is deeply embedded in the social? And has a responsibility to community?’ She has yet to inaugurate her programme at the Guggenheim, but for an institution embroiled in a race row prior to her arrival (an investigation found no evidence), she is a force of positive disruption.",

Yet Apichatpong is perhaps most comfortable on set, among the lush landscapes he had made his own, and in August he returned to the forest, specifically the jungles of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, to lead a ten day Herzogesque workshop for emerging filmmakers; next year he will be in Sri Lanka, making a film inspired by Arthur C. Clarke, cowriter of the screenplay for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and longtime resident of the country.",

Her day job is as a legal translator and contributor to both El País and monthly magazine Este País, her columns for the latter being released this year as a collection; combined with her increased online presence through talks during the pandemic, her profile has grown way beyond Mexico. Through these she articulates not just how Mexico has cannibalised the culture of those colonised nations, but how the obliteration of Indigenous languages and knowledge is a violence perpetuated globally: from Latin America to the Ainu people in Japan or the Sámi people of the Arctic north. This year she joined with actor Gael García Bernal to make a documentary series on climate change.",

That she’s contributed to revivifying her medium was reflected in Sillman’s presence in Cecilia Alemani’s international exhibition at this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/59th-venice-biennale-review-revelation-and-illusion/], where the American painter’s big paintings on dangling paper moved like a filmstrip, her restless compositions semaphoring suggestions of human and animal bodies. Meanwhile, for latecomers, images from that show fold into a soon-to-come reissue of her terrific 2020 book of selected writings, Faux Pas. It’s been a long ride since her career’s mid-1970s outset, but Sillman is finally being recognised as a multi-talented modern master.",

            "With striking Hollywood actors and AI-generated artworks winning art competitions, the question of whether machines are going to take over artmaking is a hot topic. Musician Herndon and artist partner Dryhust have been ahead of that particular question for years; Herndon’s clear-sighted experiments into AI songmaking resulted in Holly+, her ‘digital twin’, who can reshape existing songs in Herndon’s own voice. (Herndon is also on the 2024 jury for the Paris-based IRCAM’s prestigious Generative Music Prize.) As the implications of AI learning from art made by humans become clearer, the pair have been vocal advocates [https://artreview.com/ai-art-and-the-problem-of-consent/] of artists’ rights; in March their online tool – allowing artists to check if their work has been used to train AI models, and opt out – attracted 40,000 signatories, with several AI companies agreeing to respect artists’ wishes, including Stability AI. It’s no wonder that Herndon made Time magazine’s ‘100 AI’ list in September. As Dryhurst told Freethink magazine, ‘I don’t see any conflict between being very, very excited about… machine learning, and also being very loyal to or concerned about artist welfare’.",

Beginning with a background in quantum physics, Barad shifted their attention to feminist theory. As they wrote in 2019, ‘quantum theory is shot through with the political’. Their stance is one of entanglement and complication, where agency is a relationship, not something owned, or given or taken away – notions that apply to paintings as much as protest. Barad has been present this year with a series of talks across academic, art and philosophical contexts, from Frame Contemporary Art Finland’s ‘Gathering for Rehearsing Hospitalities’ in Helsinki to the Temporal Belonging network’s annual conference on ‘The Material Life of Time’, but even more through the incessant nods to their work, featured in pieces by Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi and Fred Moten, and their idea of the ‘intra- active’ being referenced on countless exhibition press releases.",

By the next year, after successfully establishing a museum branch and negotiating better contract terms, Kopel was laid off amid pandemic cuts. This year, in a series of articles, including the widely shared ‘Against Artsploitation’, Kopel detailed her experiences and set out the limitations of art institutions’ abilities to address inequalities, despite countless proclamations to the contrary. While others on this year’s list, such as Sara Ahmed, have long publicly spoken of these issues, Kopel’s writing has made her the unofficial spokesperson for the museum union movement, the record of a personal journey providing a galvanising and recognisable point for wider struggles happening in art institutions worldwide. ‘Labor organizing in the art world is critical, but so is acknowledging that there will never be a “good” museum under racial capitalism,’ Kopel wrote. ‘Why cling to the museum when we could start anew, toward justice?’",

Literally: in July he\nwas commissioned by Uplift Aerospace to paint the exterior of a rocket (built by the Jeff Bezos-owned company Blue Origin) that launched into space in August. Success for the artist, whose portraits are usually painted directly with his fingers, has been double-edged though, as his work has been targeted by speculative collectors looking to flip it for a quick buck. Having received a debut institutional solo show at San Francisco’s Museum of the African Diaspora, the artist himself is nonetheless determined to build his career on less mercantile foundations. At home in Accra he has expanded his own studio to include several neighbouring spaces, which other emerging artists can use for free. ‘The vision is to provide a safe space where artists can come together, practice, collaborate, experiment, and also learn to express their art in the purest of ways,’ Boafo told Artnet. ‘The art scene in Ghana has always been about collaborations and coexistence.’",

Its show at Tai Kwun, Portals, Stories, and Other Journeys, inspired by the personal archive of the Hong Kong artist Ha Bik Chuen, included ‘sets’ by five artists, among them Walid Raad and Kwan Sheung Chi, that engaged with knowledge production. Its many public education and outreach activities included a Mobile Library in Nepal developed with Siddhartha Arts Foundation, as well as a series of closed-door seminars called Art Schools of Asia. Three new archival collections were launched this year: the Oscar Ho Kong Kay Archive, the archive of Green Papaya Art Projects and Manila Artist-Run Spaces Archive.",

If Yi has a mission – citing Donna Haraway and Anna Tsing – it’s to recognise the interconnectedness of humans, nonhuman life and machines. At her talk, the artist was joined by a single ‘aerobe’, from the fleet of autonomous floating robots she premiered at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall last year. More interspecific friends were present at her retrospective at Pirelli Hangar Bicocca in Milan, this time microscopic soil bacteria and algae growing in Biologizing the Machine (spillover zoonotica) (2022). It’s telling that, such is our alienation from the nature surrounding us, Yi’s paintings at her shows at Gladstone’s New York and Seoul spaces appear as digital abstractions, not the depictions of ‘blood cells and fish eggs, scratched and ruptured skin, polyps and crustaceans’ they actually are. Yi was also invited to take part in a yearlong residency at Stanford University, where she will engage students and faculty with her research.\n\n",

The author of, among other important works, Bullshit Jobs (2018) and the magisterial Debt: The First 5,000 Years (2011), Graeber understood better than most how our current ideals amount to fraudulent advertising for crap goods. The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity (2021), which Graeber cowrote over the last decade with the archaeologist David Wengrow, was published posthumously this year. Wengrow and Graeber’s project has been to show how alternatives of social and economic organisation have been a deep part of our ancestry all along; the Rousseauian ‘state of nature’ is the myth to be shed, and what the two call the ‘Indigenous Critique’ of ‘western’ societies offers an enduring, and heartening, means to enact social and cultural innovation in the present. No recent book is gaining faster traction in the artworld right now. Artists, take note.",

But for that, someone had to buy it. MetaKovan, aka Vignesh Sundaresan, is not a conventional big-money art collector; until his winning $69m bid for Beeple’s magnum opus, the Indian crypto investor was unheard of. In December 2020 Sundaresan had bought $2.2m worth of Beeple’s works on Nifty Gateway, through his NFT ‘fund’ Metapurse. Of course, these purchases were in Ether, so Sundaresan’s entry into the artworld is really the story of the anarchic craze for cryptocurrencies, and how some savvy players have gamed this unregulated, frontier world of virtual value. Some have raised questions about Sundaresan’s activity – in November a Reuters investigation looked at the events leading to the stellar rise and crash of a new crypto coin he created for investors to buy into his NFT purchases. The moral of the tale? In crypto, some make millions, others lose them. ",

A prodigious advocate for Black artists and creatives – see his 2019 book The New Black Vanguard: Photography Between Art and Fashion; Young, Gifted and Black: A New Generation of Artists (2020), which he edited; and his highly popular Instagram account – he’s been a significant force in galleries representing and spotlighting artists of colour. So it was shrewd of Gagosian to make him a director this year, and given the gallery’s abundant resources, Sargent wasted no time in realising his exhibition-making ambitions. Social Works, his debut show at the gallery’s 24th Street space, brought together a dozen Black artists whose work engages directly with their communities, and incorporated projects ranging from Linda Goode Bryant’s functional urban farm to David Adjaye’s first largescale sculpture. While some observers worry that the artworld’s deeply belated embrace of artists of colour is a fad, figures like Sargent – razor-sharp, committed, media-savvy – will ensure it isn’t.",

Their latest work, Night Fishing with Ancestors (2023), shown this year at solo exhibitions at Secession in Vienna, the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and Goldsmiths CCA in London, as well as various screenings internationally, is typical, loosely centring on the story of eighteenth-century Macassan traders who sailed to the Australian coast from Indonesia to collect sea cucumbers, a moment of collaborative trade before the extractivist violence of white colonialism. As much as the content of their productions has won praise, woozily mixing documentary, sci-fi and humour, so has their decentred way of working, in which profits from screenings and prizes are ploughed into the development of their own community and their ongoing attempts to reclaim land from the Australian state.",

The steely labyrinth of Youth at Amsterdam’s Stedeljik Museum was augmented with wintry, Moscow-shot footage of Imhof’s muse Eliza Douglas; meanwhile, the German artist’s darkly poetic shows at Buchholz in New York and Sprüth Magers in London felt like evacuated stages, foregrounding metal lockers (mostly closed) and multipanel paintings of billowing smoke. Imhof doesn’t seem wholly done with live events, but she told Monopol this year that her performances need, she thinks, to move outside of institutions altogether. And her work increasingly resonates in the worlds of fashion and pop culture. The artworld feted Imhof again this year – she won the €50,000 Binding Culture Prize – but it increasingly looks too small for her ambitions.",

            "On closing her four-venue European travelling show at Tate Britain in February, Yiadom-Boakye was confirmed as one of Britain’s foremost painters, leaving critics enamoured with her oil paintings of timeless figures – all Black, some posed, some acting out everyday playful scenes. ‘A living old master’, The Guardian reckoned. ‘Her touch is sublime. She animates a face with a few marks and patches of bare canvas,’ commented the Evening Standard. ‘[A] very, very good painter. Thick and rough with the brush but just precise enough,’ thought Time Out. Ever prolific, she went on in March to fill the Guggenheim Bilbao with a selection of over 70 paintings and charcoal drawings, all shown for the first time and made in the last three years. Being one of the leading practitioners of Black figuration comes with commercial success too: her 2015 painting Six Birds in the Bush, a portrait of a young Black man sporting a purple feather in his hat and who appears as though caught in a daydream, sold for £2.95m at Sotheby’s in October.",

The book, which has evolved from the Feral Atlas online project, considers (as has come to be expected from the UC Santa Cruz professor), the unexpected outcomes and responsibilities of humanity’s methods of populating and extracting from the planet – as told through the nonhuman presence of, for example, beetles, water hyacinths and dry rot fungus. While this year saw publication of a new edition of her 2004 book Friction, using forest fires in Indonesia to reflect on globalisation, her more recent articles and talks have focused on concrete and how its use in the built environment precipitates floods. As climates continue to shift, artists continue to look to Tsing to help map the new terrain.",

Haynes is to take things slower and make things riskier than the market normally demands, opening with a solo show for Kandis Williams, an artist who explores race, authority and eroticism through collage, performance, video, assemblage and installation work. The gallery will then proceed at a leisurely pace through four further shows in 2022, featuring Nikita Gale, Nora Turato, Tiona Nekkia McClodden and Tau Lewis, each accompanied by an issue of Clarion, the gallery’s in-house journal. It’s an approach that’s catching on: in December Haynes will curate part of the NADA Miami art fair, featuring similar risk-taking galleries. Haynes also runs an online programme that offers professional-practice workshops, for free, to Black students worldwide; herself a model of how to change the system from within. ",

We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more: Physical property – houses, unique artwork, Virtual collectables – unique pictures of kittens, collectable cards…’ Four years on from its publication, ‘ERC-721’, the specification for the ‘non-fungible token’ (on the Ethereum-based blockchain – other specifications exist) has upended the art market, bringing contemporary art and millennial meme culture crashing together. With projects such as CryptoPunks starting the craze for gamified virtual collectibles in 2017, ERC-721 turned data into virtual property, and the artworld began to realise that digital culture can be made rare. With staggering prices achieved for Beeple’s work in the last year, the art market has discovered a new generation of collectors, while artists around the world have discovered a way to market their art that bypasses the old art-dealer system. It’s hard to predict the long-term upset this bit of code will cause. But in 2021, all the old assumptions of the art market and art culture have been thrown into chaotic, creative uncertainty.",

Meanwhile, Glimcher, together with former Pace London president Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, inaugurated Superblue centres in Miami and London, institutionalising the immersive art experience they cofounded and which has now drawn over 25,000 visitors in its itinerant form, here with the likes of A.A. Murakami and Es Devlin providing the crowd-pleasing ambience. Yet bricks and mortar are only part of the picture for Glimcher: he has also set up an NFT platform and will take payment in cryptocurrency, strategies rumoured to be among the reasons Jeff Koons joined Pace. This year wasn’t all plain sailing, though: in March Glimcher saw the departure of two senior staffers, Douglas Baxter and Susan Dunne, following bullying claims against them. ",

Started in 2019, her curatorial and publication project, Animistic Apparatus, which examines the correspondences between Southeast Asian moving images and animistic practices, had a screening at Amsterdam’s Other Futures festival this year, and while her book, Animistic Medium: Contemporary Southeast Asian Artists Moving Image, is forthcoming. Currently, she is professor of cinematic arts at the University of Westminster, where she codirects the Centre for Research and Education in Arts and Media. Her work in general traces the ways in which our relationship with the screen has evolved to open new potentialities for the medium.",

In Black Meme, Russell traces how, from the days of silent cinema to TikTok and GIFs, the Black subject has been reduced to archetype, not least via the hyperviolent ‘viral’ imagery of slain figures such as Emmett Till or Philando Castile, while likening the distribution of souvenir postcards of public lynchings to the sharing of memes. Russell isn’t just commenting on visual culture; she has a mission to change it. She told Vanity Fair, ‘Many people would agree that the artworld is in a state of disarray… We’re seeing many failures and also through those failures many opportunities to change.’ This year, the curator’s group show on ‘black data’, Code Switch: Distributing Blackness, Reprogramming Internet Art, organised by The Kitchen across various US venues, and a presentation at Berggruen Arts & Culture in Venice by artist and poet Rhea Dillon helped further that cause.",

The foundation has also committed £800,000 to two arts institutions, Wysing Arts Centre and the UAL Decolonising Arts Institute, which combined will support 120 artists from underrepresented backgrounds in presenting work at museums and galleries around the country. Alongside this, the non-profit supports another 15 organisations including the Arts Council, Open School East, and Create London, and has loaned £3m to the worldwide Arts & Culture Impact Fund. The Freelands Award, which gives a mid-career female artist a prize of £100,000, continues annually; this year, the prize is awarded to Jacqueline Poncelet.",

Earlier this year, Doğan told ArtReview that ‘In sexist discourses, the earth is personified as a woman’s body, becoming, like a woman’s body, something to be possessed. I draw and paint women who oppose this fate’. Her opposition has led her to serve time in prison on different occasions, and in Prison n°5, a graphic novel she released this year (and for which she was awarded the 2021 Le Soir Prize for News Report Comic Strips), she returns to her experience of incarceration at Diyarbakır prison.

            "Working with Dominique Fontaine, López’s cocurated Toronto Biennial [https://artreview.com/toronto-biennial-curators-named-miguel-a-lopez-dominique-fontaine/] this year took the title Precarious Joys, and touched on, in the curators’ words, questions of ‘environmental justice’, ‘collective memory’, ‘feminist genealogies’, ‘weaving as spiritual listening’, ‘resistance and resilience’. If these are in keeping with current curatorial fashions, they have been López’s interests for a while, from his early days running Teorética in San José, Costa Rica, and as evergreen chief champion of Cecilia Vicuña [https://artreview.com/artist/cecilia-vicuna/]. The Chilean artist was included in Toronto, marking the latest chapter in a relationship dating back to a 2019 retrospective López curated at the Witte de With (now Kunstinstituut Melly), Rotterdam, and which travelled to Mexico City, Madrid and Bogotá. Dreaming Water, a second survey of the artist’s work curated by López, opened this year at the Pinacoteca de São Paulo, following stops at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago, and MALBA, Buenos Aires. In April, López delivered the keynote lecture at the 2024 Curatorial Forum conference (organised by Independent Curators International), which focused on art and civic responsibility.",

            "With Frieze, where Fox is CEO and Siddall is board director, forced to cancel all its physical fairs last year, there was much talk as to whether the model had had its day. This year the Los Angeles edition was cancelled again, and the New York fair opened in May, in a new central Manhattan location, much scaled down with just over 60 exhibitors. By the time Frieze London swung round in October however the chatter looked empty as the fair signalled a return to pre-pandemic normal with over 250 galleries setting up shop in Regent’s Park. Emanuel, CEO of parent company Endeavor, is clearly betting on the art fair’s continued relevance, green lighting the announcement of a new fair in Seoul next year. There’s some sensible precautions being taken however: having long supported the Condo London gallery swap, Frieze monetised the model with year-round gallery spaces in London’s Mayfair available for hire by out-of-town dealers.",

In 15 years the Rajas have not only built and established two galleries in the city and a third in Mumbai, but also an entire ecosystem, created through the Experimenter Curators’ Hub, which held its 14th edition this year; their online learning-orientated Experimenter Labs; Experimenter Books; an outpost exhibition programme that ‘inhabits disused, characterful spaces’; and the Generator Co-operative Art Production Fund, which offers small bursaries for art production. TRI opened with solo shows by Experimenter artists Prabhakar Pachpute and Kallol Datta, while at the same time during Mumbai Gallery Weekend the Rajas staged exhibitions by Afrah Shafiq and Alexandra Bachzetsis, and camp’s monumental 2022 seven-channel installation Bombay Tilts Down could be seen in the open air down at the city’s docks. This autumn, Sohrab Hura opened his first US survey show at New York’s MoMA PS1.",

City Hall’s disapproval apparently related to an exhibition programme that lacked tourist-friendly crowd-pleasers (2024 shows included solos for tech-focused sculptor Aleksandra Domanović and experimental filmmaker Diego Marcon [https://artreview.com/diego-marcons-hollow-people/]), as well as poor visitor numbers (though WHW’s tenure coincided with the pandemic). The termination of WHW’s employment caused one member of the institution’s board to quit; meanwhile, the trio left a valedictory postscript in the form of a 62m mural by Nora Turato reading, ‘Aaaaaaaa…!!!!!!’ – the first of an annual public artwork commission established during WHW’s time in office. They won’t be dwelling on the past, though: WHW’s departure gives them more time to prepare for the 2027 edition of Skulptur Projekte Münster. Their appointment as the first female curators of the exhibition was announced [https://artreview.com/what-how-for-whom-to-direct-skulptur-projekte-munster-2027/] in August.",

Then its art fairs in Hong Kong, Basel and Miami were cancelled (or went online; ‘It doesn’t work,’ dealer Dominique Lévy summed up), precipitating a ten percent staff loss at Art Basel. So there was a lot riding on 2021, especially now that Art Basel global director Spiegler has the backing of Murdoch’s Lupa Systems investment vehicle, MCH’s ‘anchor shareholder’. Hong Kong, though delayed, went off without a hitch (a relief given that Spiegler had promised full refunds if the fair was cancelled), and the Swiss edition was judged a slow but steady success, despite the notable absence of American collectors. Spiegler had enticed 272 galleries with a 10 percent discount, a promise to cover hotel quarantines and a CHF1.5m (£1.2m) ‘solidarity relief fund’ for those disappointed by sales (97 galleries took up the offer). Miami returns with 254 exhibitors, roughly its prepandemic level. Murdoch’s art interest goes beyond booths: this year he invested in an art-focused NFT marketplace.",

The London gallery opened a survey of the late painter Atta Kwami, which moved to the New York space, complementing its inaugural full year of programming, featuring Misheck Masamvu, Zineb Sedira and Kapwani Kiwanga, among others. Meanwhile, visitors to the Cheetah Plains luxury safari lodge on the Sabi Sand Nature Reserve may have gone for the lions and leopards, but could stay for the art: in January it opened a private art gallery in partnership with Goodman Gallery, to the delight of its the wildlife-hungry holidaymakers.",

He’s also a stylist whose steady stream of digestibly short, aphorism-filled books pair well with social media-tinged attention spans. Titling his 2023 book Via Contemplativa: In Praise of Inactivity might seem a little at odds, coming from such a prolific writer, though it’s a paean to the unhurried contemplation of reality, rather than commendation for doing nothing at all. And if said reality gives you the shivers, this year the Korean-German thinker published the Anselm Kiefer-illustrated The Spirit of Hope – ‘a plea against the crisis of fear’ by the same writer who also in 2024 put out The Crisis of Narration, which lamented the loss of richly complex storytelling and the social media-fuelled shift towards ‘storyselling’. Problems everywhere, then, but it’s all grist to Han’s fast-moving diagnostic mill.",

On the Boston waterfront the artist placed Last Garment (2022), a bronze sculpture based on a nineteenth-century Jamaican washerwoman. The exhibition travelled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, in November, and a new edition of another Venice work by Leigh, Sentinel (2022), entered the collection of the city’s National Gallery of Art in August. Such institutional acclaim naturally helps the bottom line: in May Leigh’s 2019 bronze Stick sold for a record $2.7m at auction.",

The new 2046 Fermentation + Fellowships programme, awarded to 18 young Hong Kong artists, includes reciprocal learning and support sessions and invites participants to apply for individual grants of HK$20,000 to realise a proposal. Meanwhile, Para Site’s NoExit Grant for Unpaid Artistic Labour continues into its second year: 28 Filipino artists received HK$20,000 each for unconditional use. It was business-as-usual programming this year. A long-running open call for emerging curators produced Alvin Li and Junyuan Feng’s Liquid Ground; an institutional tie-up with Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum resulted in Curtains; and a solo exhibition by Hong Kong-based artist Luke Ching Chin Wai questioned wider structures in society. Meanwhile, Costinas’s postponed edition of the Kathmandu Triennale is scheduled to take place this coming February.",

During that time, as the energetic heiress has showcased her collection at dedicated venues in Düsseldorf and Berlin, Stoschek’s taste for moving-image, time-based and digital art has marked her as a rare collector with a clearcut, non-identikit agenda. In 2023, while continuing to sit on the board of KW Institute, Stoschek oversaw shows by underknown septuagenarian Black video artist Ulysses Jenkins and emerging South Korean multimedia artist Young-jun Tak, a six-decade survey of video-based performance art and a Hans Ulrich Obrist-curated exploration of the intersection between art and videogames. Meanwhile, after a 2022 marred by revelations of her great-grandfather’s wartime involvement with the Nazi Party, this year Stoschek sought to redirect the narrative forwards, her foundation announcing a long-term resource-sharing collaboration with the Düsseldorf Art Academy. For someone so frequently invested in art’s present and near future, it’s an on-brand move.",

With a new Basel address and a second London space opening next year, Hauser & Wirth, run by husband and wife Iwan and Manuela, alongside Payot as president, will shortly equal Gagosian’s real estate. It is ‘a whole world you step into’, consultant Barbara Guggenheim told the Financial Times. She was not just talking about a global reach that spans from Hollywood to Hong Kong to Gstaad to New York, nor the 103 artists and artists’ estates the gallery promotes (veterans William Kentridge, Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/] and Nairy Baghramian joined the roster this year, as well as youngster George Rouy and Michaela Yearwood-Dan). The trio have also established themselves as lifestyle purveyors via their ‘art centres’ in Somerset and Menorca, and, above all, through Iwan and Manuela’s loss-leading Artfarm hospitality company, which owns restaurants, hotels, pubs and, not least, London’s Groucho Club, all adorned with the work of gallery artists. If, as one cynic put it, also to the FT, ‘galleries are event organisers for rich and lonely people’, then Hauser & Wirth definitely fills the void.",

Mbembe’s most recent book, The Earthly Community (2022), presents the bleak trajectory of technocapitalism, but also posits a possible escape route through African cosmologies and the power of African aesthetics and figurative objects. The author has been touring his book globally and received rave reviews for his radical call for an African future: in June he gave a lecture at the University of Bergen (while receiving the Holberg Prize, the first African to do so), and in November he was billed as the star attraction of the biennial Maputo Fast Forward Festival. In São Paulo for the 9th International Theatre Festival, he told Veja that ‘we must fight to ensure that no person of African descent is a stranger in Africa’, arguing that the continent should institute a right of return.",

The group has long worked in Palestine, and in January the first exhibition of its Ramallah-based offshoot, the Forensic Architecture Investigation (FAI) Unit, was staged at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Arts and Sciences. The exhibition displayed its trademark analysis of found field recordings, media imagery and satellite pictures, as well as 3D animated reconstructions used to create second-by-second retellings of contested events. The unit, set up in 2020, is a collaboration with Al-Haq, a human rights organisation, but one that has been designated a terrorist group by Israel’s Ministry of Defense, and Forensic Architecture has been the subject of much criticism from commentators, particularly in Germany. Shows at Württembergische Kunstverein Stuttgart and Museum im Kulturspeicher (MiK), Würzburg, both concerning racist and anti-immigration violence in Germany, went ahead, however.\n\nThe methodology they pioneered, in applying aesthetic analysis to news and events, has proven widely influential, while affiliates and former members, including artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan [https://artreview.com/artist/lawrence-abu-hamdan/] and curator Anselm Franke, have spread this further in their own work. Positioning artistic tools and interdisciplinary creative research as means to generate evidence of what they term ‘state and corporate violence’, their work’s proposal of art as something that can be instrumentalised is apparently an alluring one for many artists, suggesting art installation as antidote to an image-dominated, post-truth landscape. The current show at CIVA, Brussels, shows their 2023 work on prehistoric architecture in what is now Ukraine; their work on former plantations in Louisiana, USA, becoming petrochemical factories on view at the Wellcome Collection, London; and a selection of their ongoing work on medical staff in Gaza over the past year being exhibited in Vienna. Alongside museum exhibitions also in Istanbul, Portland and Cali, and biennials in Rotterdam and Yogyakarta, their work continues to have both global focus and audiences.",

Walker has spent much of his time at the foundation reorienting the philanthropic trust, from which, it was announced in July, he steps down next year [https://artreview.com/ford-foundation-president-darren-walker-announces-departure-in-2025/], to address inequality and social justice. Funding arts programmes has long been a focus within that framework: in 2024 alone this has ranged from the $1.1m the foundation gave to bankroll Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/]’s pavilion at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] (Gibson was the first Indigenous artist to represent the US at the event), to the $500k each given to the Los Angeles Museum of Art, New York’s The Kitchen and the Whitney (specifically for the exhibition of choreographer and Civil Rights activist Alvin Ailey), and the $2k given to National Portrait Gallery staffers to attend a migrant justice conference. Eyeing up his future spare time, in October Walker, already a trustee to the Smithsonian, became president [https://artreview.com/darren-walker-helms-national-gallery-of-art-washington-d-c/] of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.",

They opened the Muholi Art Institute in Cape Town last year, offering residencies lasting six months to a year, with a stipend, housing and studio costs covered; the fruits of which were featured in an exhibition at Jonathan Carver Moore gallery in San Francisco in June. In February the institute presented a group exhibition, EMBODYING #HER, spotlighting the work of established and emerging women-identifying and queer artists.",

Weems, who was awarded the US National Medal of Arts [https://artreview.com/carrie-mae-weems-awarded-2024-national-medal-of-arts/] by the departing President Biden in October, also revisited The Kitchen Table, her 1990 series of images capturing a fictional drama featuring the artist herself amid scenes of Black American domestic life. She referenced the project in a commission for fashion brand Bottega Veneta, with a campaign showing rapper A$AP Rocky and his baby child sitting down for dinner. Two works from the original series were included in a tv advertisement for Kamala Harris, and Weems produced a billboard for the Democratic presidential candidate, as well as hosting a programme of readings, live music and food at New York’s Gladstone Gallery on election day.",

The event was a prelude to next year’s Infinite Ecologies Marathon, marking ten years of climate-focused events organised by Pietroiusti at the Serpentine, and representative of the curator’s belief that art can platform cross-disciplinary ideas on tackling the climate crisis. One of the leading ecologically minded curators, she is a regular on the panel discussion and jury circuit. This year she curated a screening programme for a ‘more-than-human curiosity’ symposium in the Czech Republic, and serves as a trustee of the Gallery Climate Coalition, which includes hundreds of galleries and institutions worldwide.

All the countries had artists representing them at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] who have passed through London’s very own United Nations, the Delfina Foundation. More alumni of the exhibition and residency programmes – directed by Cezar for the past 17 years – including the likes of Manauara Clandestina, Dana Awartani, Lydia Ourahmane, Ali Cherri, Larissa Sansour and Ahmet Öğüt, could be found in the Biennale’s main show [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/] and collateral events. This year, Cezar could also be seen across the world, from a talks programme in India to a gin brand launch during Hong Kong’s Art Week: not only is he scouting for talent, but also on the lookout for £7m, the amount needed to secure the institution’s future since the death of its patron and founder, Delfina Entrecanales, in 2022. Meanwhile in London, two shows: a five-artist exhibition curated by Dominican artist Yina Jiménez Suriel and solo exhibitions for Indian artist Soumya Sankar Bose [https://artreview.com/soumya-sankar-bose-in-search-of-lost-time/] and Myanmar artist Moe Satt.",

The programme was organised as a collaboration between the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, where Andrew is adjunct curator, and the University of Melbourne, where he is ‘director of reimagining museums and collections’, and where he founded BLAK C.O.R.E., a collective driven by First Nations methodologies, research and cultural practice. Andrew continues as artistic associate of the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, where he is curating a show on global Indigeneity in 2026. There was also a public lightwork for Footscray, a suburb of Melbourne, featuring Andrew’s trademark black-and-white Op-art patterning; and preparations are underway for a second architectural commission, next to Sydney Central station. Now represented by Sydney- and Singapore-based Ames Yavuz, he had a show earlier in the year at Frieze’s No. 9 Cork Street gallery in London, alongside Pinaree Sanpitak.",

How does that square with a country likely to feel the effects of the climate emergency most sharply? It is something the summit addressed head-on with works, curated by Campbell, ranging from Joydeb Roaja’s largescale immersive installation addressing environmental displacement to puppetry performances by children that reflected on climate change. The Samdanis are also establishing the Srihatta, their permanent foundation and sculpture park in rural Bangladesh, delayed but set to open to the public and for artist residencies next year. Away from Bangladesh, Nadia received the Order of Arts and Letters from French Ministry of Culture, and Campbell took control of Desert X in the Coachella Valley in March, again on the climatic beat, linking droughts and floods in California and Bangladesh.",

If the Indonesian collective hoped to return to lives not under constant scrutiny – no such luck: Documenta put out apologetic statements after two members ‘liked’ a social media post depicting a pro-Palestine celebration the day of Hamas’s attack on Israel (Reza Afisina and Iswanto Hartono, both currently visiting professors at the University of Fine Arts Hamburg, also apologised, saying they mistakenly thought the video showed police breaking up the demonstration).

If the report quickly became an influential framework for institutions across Europe to grapple with the colonial legacies within their collections, it is now starting to bear tangible fruits, with multiple Western institutions and governments (committing to) returning artefacts acquired through force, clandestine excavation, corruption or theft. Most notably, Germany and Nigeria signed a memorandum of understanding concerning 1,100 artefacts held in German ethnological museums to go on display in a new institution in Benin City, designed by David Adjaye. Meanwhile, in France the report’s influence was felt throughout the historical Africa-France Summit, convened by Macron under the leadership of Achille Mbembe. If some critics dismiss these gestures as moves to cultivate soft power in former colonies, they still constitute concrete steps towards the decolonialisation of Western institutions and the cultural reappropriation of African heritage.",

While the walls of the museum back then were dominated by art by white people, Joyner is determined to use the wealth she has accrued through a career in finance to collect and lend the work of Black artists. This year Joyner donated 31 paintings, sculptures and drawings by 20 American artists from the African diaspora to SFMoMA (where she is a trustee, alongside board positions at MoMA, the J. Paul Getty Trust, Tate Americas and the Chicago Art Institute). The works were selected by Joyner to plug gaps in SFMoMA’s collection, offering new, more inclusive readings of art history. ‘What I want visitors to take away is that there were people of colour not only working in the field,’ Joyner said this year, ‘but defining the character of the movement at that time.’",

While her videos, performances and, most recently, virtual reality works continue to speak to technological progress and the transformation of China, it is the human experience in all of this that fascinates her the most – and has led to her staying power. ‘I come from the pre-internet era,’ she has said, ‘and what moves me is the relationship formed through emotions, people, objects and the world, not only algorithms and data.’ It is this broadness in her curiosity that registers with audiences, not least those visiting the Lenbachhaus in Munich, where her work explored the relationship between digital culture and the real and virtual worlds. The artist also had solo exhibitions at SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (where the artist transformed the galleries into, for example, a Beijing cinema foyer and a yum cha restaurant, with the help of Hong Kong-based Beau Architects) and Museum of Art Pudong in Shanghai, the last being Cao’s largest to date.",

But Preciado remains, as ever, the intellectual face for the instabilities of gender and biopolitics, and a world that’s in transition. Often cited by artists, Preciado’s work made its way into the Spanish Pavilion [https://artreview.com/venice-biennale-2024-a-guide-to-the-giardini/#:~:text=dense%20and%20captivating-,Spain%20Pavilion,-presents%20hundreds%20of] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] this year, where Sandra Gamarra [https://artreview.com/sandra-gamarra-heshiki-on-representing-spain-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] took a sentence from a lecture by the thinker to accompany a work she had made: ‘trans body is to normative heterosexuality what Palestine is to the West: a colony whose extension and form is perpetuated only through violence’.",

This year found the 2020 MacArthur genius-grant awardee taking time out from lecturing on performance studies at NYU (as well as his fellowship at Harvard and other-coast gig at UC Riverside) to lecture on subjects including the poetics of W.E.B. Du Bois and to participate in the Harvard conference ‘Jews and Black Theory: Conceptualizing Otherness’. (In a report on the latter, his performance-inflected keynote was described as a talk that ‘defies summarizing’.) But Moten, who has historically collaborated with artists such as Wu Tsang [https://artreview.com/artist/wu-tsang/], is himself as much a creative maker as a parser of ideas. In 2024, in addition to giving onstage poetry readings (he’s now published ten books of verse), he released and gigged the blacksmiths, the flowers, his second album alongside jazz rhythm section Brandon López and Gerald Cleaver, with Moten – who else – taking care of the words.",

            "With over 800,000 people passing through her Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/59th-venice-biennale-review-revelation-and-illusion/] last year, Alemani fell into the groove of in-demand curator, albeit not of the airport-hopping kind. While her Biennale remains a touchstone of how to handle a largescale, in-depth exhibition, this year she has collaborated with various commercial sidelines within spitting distance of the High Line, New York, where she is director. Alemani’s commissions at the latter include work by Pamela Rosenkranz, Yu Ji and Gabriel Chaile, among others. At Gagosian, just a block from the linear sculpture park’s entrance, Alemani curated a Tetsuya Ishida retrospective, featuring more than 80 of the late Japanese artist’s nightmarishly surreal paintings. And a mere two blocks further on, at the old Dia Chelsea premises, Alemani staged an exhibition of work by 70 women artists owned by collectors Komal Shah and Gaurav Garg (which will travel to California’s Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive and the Kemper Art Museum in St Louis). Whether the carbon-footprint-conscious Alemani left Chelsea to sit on the jury of Canada’s Sobey prize [https://artreview.com/kablusiak-wins-2023-sobey-art-award/] is unknown.",

During his leadership at Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, which commenced in January 2023, Ndikung has had to accommodate the institution’s commitment to artists of the Global South, where support for Palestine is high, while being alert to the pro-Israel stance of much of the local audience and media. In November last year, pro-Palestine protesters hung a banner at the entrance to the institution, and in April they interrupted a conference titled ‘Remembering Colonialism’. In the exhibition halls, the Euro 2024 football tournament provided a structure for the museum to reflect on migration, gender and racism in sport. The announcement then that Ndikung will curate the 2025 Bienal de São Paulo [https://artreview.com/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung-to-curate-the-36th-bienal-de-sao-paulo/] under the title Not All Travellers Walk Roads – Of Humanity as Practice offered a welcome relief, with a series of precursor research conferences already underway in Morocco and Guadeloupe.",

We come to fuck shit up.’ That fucking up of shit takes the form of mesmerising films concerning Blackness, death and history. At LUMA Westbau, in Zurich, he remixed his 2013 work APEX, slowing down the original eight-minute video collage to 33 minutes and adding accompanying beats by Detroit techno pioneer Robert Hood. A newfound interest in abstraction was present in LOML (2022), which paid homage to the late writer and musician Greg Tate, shown at the Gwangju Biennale. Meanwhile Melbourne audiences got the greatest hits, including Love is the Message, The Message is Death [https://artreview.com/work-of-the-week-arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message/] (2016), at the Fiona and Sidney Myer Gallery, and last year’s survey [https://artreview.com/a-guide-to-arts-and-culture-this-november/] at OGR Torino closed in February. Meanwhile a collaboration with Supreme became mired in controversy when the fashion brand’s creative director departed, citing the company’s ‘systemic racism’.",

Naturally this is tricky territory, and Attia soon hit controversy after three Iraqi artists, and one of his curatorial team, quit the show over the work of Frenchman Jean-Jacques Lebel and his blowups of the notorious Abu Ghraib prison images [https://artreview.com/art-and-the-limits-of-awareness-politics-berlin-biennale-abu-ghraib/]. Attia apologised, but to no avail. The artist, whose sculpture and installations also deal with postcolonial identity, no doubt found life easier with the day job, closing a solo show at Mathaf, Doha, in March, and exhibiting at the Aichi Triennale in Japan, and in YOYI!

Pei [https://artreview.com/red-flags-in-hong-kong-art-scene-report-ilaria-maria-sala/#:~:text=seven%20decades%20of-,I.M.%20Pei%E2%80%99s,-architecture%20%E2%80%93%20although%20Pei], as well as shows celebrating Lee Mingwei, Zhang Peili, Haegue Yang and Apichatpong Weerasethakul [https://artreview.com/artist/apichatpong-weerasethakul/?year=2023], whose seminal video installation Primitive (2009) was shown in Hong Kong [https://artreview.com/the-top-exhibitions-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/#:~:text=through%209%20June-,Apichatpong%20Weerasethakul,-%2C%20M%2B] for the first time. Earlier this year it was reported that West Kowloon Cultural District, of which M+ is something of a flagship, faced a funding shortfall; the authority managed to secure government funding, but continues to look for steady private investment.",

Walker’s European touring show A Black Hole is Everything a Star Longs to Be closed its second stop, at Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt, in January, before opening for Dutch audiences at the De Pont Museum in Tilburg, in July. Australians also got a taste of Walker’s practice, with a show at the National Art Gallery, Canberra, while a survey of her drawings opened at Sprüth Magers, London, in the summer. Although her vast drawings, cutout black paper silhouettes and monumental sculpture ostensibly concentrate on the history of North American race relations and the traumas and resilience of African Americans (and are shown widely across the US, appearing in over 24 group shows this year alone), her influence can be felt beyond her home country, teasing out moments of the Black experience with subtle ease – not least in her recent turn in the Afrofuturism-themed In the Black Fantastic [https://artreview.com/the-past-and-future-of-afrofuturism/] at London’s Hayward Gallery.",

They write, ‘political morality takes time, a patient and courageous way of learning and naming’, a slowness lost in the media churn of outrage and easy condemnation. Considerations such as these come naturally to the Gender Trouble (1990) author and comparative literature professor at UC Berkeley, who remains a champion of queer and gender theory, and who published The Livable and the Unlivable this year (coauthored with Frédéric Worms), a treatise on intersectional care in the face of identity-based and ecological violence. It was these subjects and more that they picked up with a series of speakers – among them philosophers Paul B. Preciado, Elsa Dorlin, Hourya Bentouhami and psychoanalyst Monique David-Ménard – in the first of their events organised as part of being the 2023–24 intellectual-in-residence at the Pompidou in Paris.",

Lee’s approach, which has focused on organising prominent international exhibitions, including collateral shows at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], made their name – as well as her own. Now that Seoul has become a major node in the art market, Lee, whose gallery was founded in 1982 and represents approximately 50 artists, including Haegue Yang and the newly signed eighty-nine-year-old sculptor Kim Yun Shin (featured in this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/]), is more ambivalent about how helpful artworld hype can be. ‘I think we should not be “too excited” about the Korean art scene being globally recognized, becoming another art hub in Asia… Both galleries and artists should stay on their toes,’ she warned The Korea Herald. Now a family affair, with Lee’s children involved, Kukje is no doubt in it for the long haul.",

He remained in charge, however, of the K11 Art Foundation, which holds exhibitions in its various branded venues (tied to New World’s property portfolio) and arranges discussion forums – labelled ‘Salons’, this year in Seoul, London and Saudi Arabia – as well as artist residences. Also in 2024: the inaugural K11 Artist Prize, designed to support emerging Asian artists and spearheaded by the foundation’s International Council, featuring prominent collectors Sarah Arison and Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo [https://artreview.com/artist/patrizia-sandretto-re-rebaudengo/], and cultural strategist Alia Al-Senussi among its members. Cheng said his resignation permits him more time for public service, which includes chairing the Hong Kong government’s Mega Arts and Cultural Events Committee, responsible for providing incentives to major international events (such as Art Basel’s HK edition), and the various museum boards he attends, including New York’s MoMA PS1 and the Met, Paris’s Centre Pompidou and London’s Tate and Royal Academy of Arts.",

At least in part, the growing mightiness of the African artworld is down to the curator’s own efforts. As the director of Cape Town’s Zeitz MOCAA since 2019, and having established her name through the RAW Material Company in Senegal, Kouoh has become a leading light at home and abroad. Current shows at the institution include solos for Ghanaian-American artist Rita Mawuena Benissan [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-november-2024/#:~:text=Rita%20Mawuena%20Benissan] and South African Nolan Oswald Dennis. Earlier this year, Kunstmuseum Basel opened When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting [https://artreview.com/a-century-of-black-figuration-in-painting-review/], a survey exhibition curated by Kouoh that debuted at Zeitz. Not that it has all been plain sailing: in June, the artist Tracey Rose lambasted Kouoh and Kunstmuseum Bern, claiming that a work about Palestine had been censored [https://artreview.com/kunstmuseum-bern-hosting-tracey-rose-retrospective-branded-despicable-by-artist/] in her solo show at the Swiss institution, curated by Kouoh. Earlier this year, Kouoh oversaw Zeitz MOCAA’s annual gala, the proceeds of which help fund its educational and curatorial programming.",

Other blockbusters included Maurizio Cattelan: The Last Judgement (the artist’s first solo exhibition in China), on view at UCCA Beijing this winter, while over at coastal outpost Dune, Daniel Arsham’s fictional ruins engaged with the site’s geological features. Amidst all this, Tinari found time to curate the inaugural Ad-Diriyah Biennale in Saudi Arabia, which opened in December, while planning towards the opening of a fourth space, in Chengdu, for 2024, as part of the city’s International Art Island development (for which he’s an adviser). Perhaps UCCA curator-at-large Peter Eleey, who Tinari swiped from MoMA PS1 earlier this year, will be able to help with the load.",

Continua’s Beijing space opened in 2005. This year, while most dealers were chasing collectors to ex-urban resorts of the rich, Continua took a punt on central Paris (as well as a popup for Anish Kapoor in Dubai). ‘There was sadness’ to the shuttered city, Fiaschi told The Art Newspaper. They opened, he added ‘to generate smiles’, first with a JR-curated exhibition pre-refurb, followed by two group shows. Still undergoing renovation is the controversially privatised Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo, where the gallery staged a small show of Cuban artists in anticipation of opening a space within the complex.

            "Being dubbed ‘the Bob Ross of light art meets climate change’ by Artnet\nis a backhanded compliment, but like the late American TV personality, Eliasson has enormous appeal. His big hits might be behind him (for now at least), but the voracious mingling of art, architecture, ecology and new technology continues unabated. A solo exhibition at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, which featured old classics as well as new commissions (including Under the Weather, 2022, a huge elliptical patterned screen hanging above the building’s courtyard that changes as the viewer moves about), was also a chance to launch a trippy ever-changing colour-field virtual-reality NFT (commissioned by Beeple collector Metakovan). The artist’s aim – whether he’s producing gallery shows (in Seoul, Madrid, Los Angeles), institutional exhibitions (additional solos at Castello di Rivoli and Munich’s Pinakothek), largescale outdoor commissions (for a Californian winery, or in the Qatari desert) or magazine covers (produced for Time ahead of COP27) – is to make the viewer acutely aware of their – and the – environment.",

As the former member of the Italian Communist Party told Vogue this year, family takes up another third, while the rest of her time is devoted to ‘culture and the Fondazione’. The Venice-and-Milan-based private institution is no trinket (with Tokyo and Shanghai project spaces), and Prada is very hands-on, telling Vogue how she struggled to find a curator who would fully embrace her vision of a future show on feminism. She did, however, get the likes of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler to curate Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Technology and Power, 1500–2025, a Marx-tinged show on tech and power that closed in January; while Meriem Bennani installed a solo exhibition in Milan, Christoph Büchel [https://artreview.com/christoph-buchel-monte-di-pieta-fondazione-prada-venice-biennale/] in Venice, Michaël Borremans in China and Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin in Japan.",

Last year Sandretto Re Rebaudengo was named president of Fondazione Arte CRT, which supplies loans and new work to the Turin Civic Gallery (GAM) and Castello di Rivoli, as well as site-specific commissions for OGR Torino, and has since doubled the foundation’s annual acquisitions budget to €1m. The patron, whose Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo has amassed a collection of more than 1,500 artworks, has long had exhibition spaces in Turin and neighbouring Guarene, but in recent years she’s been expanding her reach: she’s turning a Venetian island into an art centre (set to open next year), and the Madrid wing of the Fondazione is now homing in on a permanent HQ. Sandretto also sits on committees at New York’s MoMA, New Museum and CCS Bard, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, London’s Tate Modern, Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum and Barcelona’s Fundación MACBA, among others. At her eponymous Turin foundation meanwhile, she gave solo shows to The Otolith Group, Stefanie Heinze and Bekhbaatar Enkhtur.",

The advancement added another asset to his portfolio: the STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery. Three months later, a partnership deal was announced between NGS, where 70 percent of the collection is dedicated to Singaporean artists and 30 percent to Southeast Asian artists, and the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts to encourage loans, research partnerships and residency programmes. The 2024 exhibitions programme at NGS featured a retrospective of Kim Lim and shows for Cheong Soo Pieng, pioneer of the Nanyang art style, and centenarian Lim Tze Peng, Singapore’s oldest living and active artist. Meanwhile, Pratchaya Phinthong and Yee I-Lann received shows at SAM which also supported the organisation of Robert Zhao Renhui’s Singaporean Pavilion [https://artreview.com/robert-zhao-renhui-on-representing-singapore-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] (NGS also made a substantial loan of eight works to the Biennale’s International Pavilion [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/], curated by Adriano Pedrosa [https://artreview.com/artist/adriano-pedrosa/?year=2024]).",

While HKW was closed at the start of the year, they continued much of their programme, such as the ongoing thread The New Alphabet, exploring alternative forms of learning, online. From the summer, the two-year project Investigative Commons was launched, following on a long collaboration with Forensic Architecture, exploring how we might re-establish notions of public truth, while the exhibition and publication Illiberal Arts addressed the inequities at the heart of liberal capitalism. The multistrand, fast-paced programme has continued with the oral history project Archive of Refuge, turning to the memories of people who migrated to Germany over the past 70 years, and working towards the conference series The White West: Whose Universal? next year. Alongside the institution’s director Bernd Scherer, Franke continues to push at the idea of what a contemporary institution can be.",

The artist had removed her work from Documenta in 2022 [https://artreview.com/hito-steyerl-says-she-has-no-faith-in-documenta-tackling-antisemitism/] due to what she perceived as inaction by its curators over antisemitism, and was scathing of many of her peers who had publicly criticised Israel, telling The Guardian that many were merely practising ‘art as social media performance’. Furthermore, she bemoaned that it was those who only condemn violence on one side ‘that dominate the debate’. Steyerl’s engagement with the conflict comes as no surprise: questions of power, violence and mediation have been her subject matter for two decades now, parlayed into her video essays and multimedia installations. This year she premiered three new works that take the Nord Stream oil pipeline system as their subject at the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, and settled into her new role as professor in Emergent Digital Media at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

            "Artist, curator, institutional director – Al Qasimi can claim to belong to nearly every constituent sector of the artworld (albeit these days she’s not really that well known for her painting). Plus, in the real world, she’s royalty. And yet, in recent years she has leveraged her expertise and knowledge of art from the Gulf region and further afield, to operate in geographies beyond the Emirate and areas in which she can absolutely rely on royal privilege. An exhibition of paintings she curated by the senior Māori artist Emily Karaka, which opened this autumn at the Sharjah Art Foundation, of which she is also president and founding director, may be indicative of the direction planned for the 2026 Biennale of Sydney [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-lead-the-2026-biennale-of-sydney/]. Al Qasimi was this year appointed curator of the Australian survey, which she will work on while developing her plans for the 2025 Aichi Triennale [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-direct-aichi-triennale-2025/] in Japan, of which she is artistic director (the first non-Japanese person to occupy the position, although she speaks the language, having studied there). Having previously curated the Lahore Biennale (in 2020) and the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Al Qasimi is in demand, and her global presence is reflected in her home institution’s programming, which, in addition to Karaka, has featured survey exhibitions of South African multimedia icon William Kentridge, Brazilian painter Antonio Dias and Pakistani artist and Women’s Action Forum cofounder Lala Rukh, not to mention the annual March Meeting [https://artreview.com/the-top-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-march-2024/#:~:text=March%20Meeting%202024%3A%20Tawashujat] conference. Next February marks the opening of the 16th Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/] (Al Qasimi curated the 2023 edition [https://artreview.com/artists-for-2023-sharjah-biennial-revealed/], developing a programme initiated by the late Okwui Enwezor, having been involved with the event – as director – since 2003, when she cocurated the sixth edition). For this edition, Al Qasimi has appointed an all-female team of curators [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] that includes many of the leading lights among curators operating in the context of the global majority, including Sri Lanka’s Natasha Ginwala [https://artreview.com/artist/natasha-ginwala/], Indonesian curator Alia Swastika [https://artreview.com/artist/alia-swastika/?year=2024], Bahraini-Singaporean artist Amal Khalaf, New Zealand artist Megan Tamati-Quennell and Turkish curator Zeynep Öz. Moreover, in the context of an artworld in which cancellations and boycotts are rife – coming from every direction – and generating a consequent culture of fear, Al Qasimi remains one of the few voices still prepared to use the platform art (and royal privilege) affords them in order to express their opinions directly and to keep discussions that most people allow to fade away firmly in the spotlight, whether they concern the current carnage in Palestine and Lebanon or those suffering from other conflicts across the globe. Beyond all that, Al Qasimi also serves as president of the International Biennale Association, president of the hugely influential Africa Institute in Sharjah and on the board of Ashkal Alwan in Beirut. She is also on the advisory boards of the Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi and Darat al Funun in Amman. Beyond her involvement with art, she also founded the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, and earlier this year presented a clothing collection in London which was developed from the work of her late brother, who worked in the fashion industry. But beyond her personal achievements, Al Qasimi is also a symbol of the increasing influence of the Gulf region in the spheres of finance, commerce, politics, sports and entertainment, and, of course (but perhaps primarily by virtue of the first two elements on this list) art.",

Organised chronologically and installed, as always, by the artist and his team (over 16 days and nights, he says), it provided an easy image of the photographer’s journey from nightclub imagery to a more wide-ranging experimentation in representing the world around him (and beyond: astronomy is a passion). Meanwhile, Fragile, a show touring African cities over the past five years, arrived at its final stop across two venues in Lagos; his solo at Mumok, Vienna, closed after an extended run in August. And then Tillmans was back in London for a round of fundraising on behalf of the ICA, where he has been chair since 2019. Demonstrating that his penchant for hedonism isn’t over, Tillmans outlined plans to make the art institution party central, including a licence to serve alcohol until 6am.",

His sculpture was the focal point of a survey that opened in May at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, materially derived from dilapidated architecture and the urban realm, and specifically informed by Freedmen’s Town in Houston’s Fourth Ward. With regards to the latter, Gates is advising an initiative that plans to preserve this historic neighbourhood built and shaped by Black people following emancipation: an endeavour that’s in the mould of the socially engaged mini-empire he has been building on the South Side of Chicago since 2006. Over in Tokyo, the artist’s Afro-Mingei exhibition at the Mori Art Museum, which imagined ‘the artistic possibilities of combining Black aesthetics and Japanese craft philosophies to envision hybrid-culture futures’, laid the groundwork for incense and sake collaborations with small family-owned businesses in Japan. This mix of commerce and creativity made him an obvious choice for Prada’s diversity council, where Gates has spearheaded a mentorship programme for designers of colour.",

            "Following on from several years of more hard-hitting, London-focused film projects – including the 2020 Small Axe series of five films that charted the lives of West Indian immigrants to the city, codirecting the documentary Uprising (2021) on a 1981 fire in South London, and his filmic monument Grenfell [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-will-not-look-away-serpentine-gallery-london/] (2023), a single-shot circling of the site of the tragic 2017 apartment block fire – the gap between McQueen’s art and cinema projects feels wider of late. This year, McQueen received a solo exhibition that continues to occupy both Dia sites in New York, with several film works and a new photographic series on display in the institution’s Chelsea space, and in a massive former factory site Beacon is his new installation Bass, the basement space filled only with coloured lighting and reverberating with snatches of music (The music an extended jam session, recorded in-situ, between different forms of the titular instrument, played by a stellar ensemble that included Meshell Ndegeochello and jazz veteran Marcus Miller.) The show received widespread acclaim, and will travel to Switzerland’s Schaulager next year. He also released the documentary Occupied City [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-review/], in which he slowly traced and filmed all the locations that appear in author, historian and producer (and McQueen’s wife) Bianca Stigter’s book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940–1945 (2019). Offering a meditative study of the Dutch capital under the Nazis, it was a cinematic tour de force that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.\n\nSo far, so auteur. McQueen’s second celluloid outing this year, Blitz, however, which opened to mixed reviews, demonstrated how mainstream he can go. Telling the story of a young boy during the World War II bombing of London, it was ‘an old-fashioned children’s adventure movie, a rollicking yarn that might have been on television on a Bank Holiday afternoon’, thought the BBC. ‘Shockingly conventional’, Variety noted. But McQueen seems confident straddling both documentary and fiction forms, as well as arthouse and (attempted) blockbuster modes, and continues to serve as a model to artists who might want to make work that can occupy the gallery, the cinema, as well as home streaming platforms.",

Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

            "Twenty years after he first planned to open a museum in Paris, this year finally saw the inauguration of Pinault’s much-hyped £140m art palace in the Bourse de Commerce, an eighteenth-century architectural landmark redesigned by architect Tadao Ando. On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

            "‘An institution is a learning system’, Obrist told Forbes this year while discussing the ‘Year of AI’ at London’s Serpentine Galleries. Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
