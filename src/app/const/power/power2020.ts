            "Russell, director of New York nonprofit space The Kitchen, published Black Meme: A History of the Images that Make Us this year, a book that follows the internet-plus-identity model established by her 2020 debut Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto. In Black Meme, Russell traces how, from the days of silent cinema to TikTok and GIFs, the Black subject has been reduced to archetype, not least via the hyperviolent ‘viral’ imagery of slain figures such as Emmett Till or Philando Castile, while likening the distribution of souvenir postcards of public lynchings to the sharing of memes. Russell isn’t just commenting on visual culture; she has a mission to change it. She told Vanity Fair, ‘Many people would agree that the artworld is in a state of disarray… We’re seeing many failures and also through those failures many opportunities to change.’ This year, the curator’s group show on ‘black data’, Code Switch: Distributing Blackness, Reprogramming Internet Art, organised by The Kitchen across various US venues, and a presentation at Berggruen Arts & Culture in Venice by artist and poet Rhea Dillon helped further that cause.",

Founded by Norberto ‘Peewee’ Roldan and Donna Miranda, its programme of artistic experimentation and development of critical discourses has, in recent years, been directed by Merv Espina. In June, while it continued to organise protests against state attempts to clamp down on civic freedoms during the pandemic, a fire tore through its archives (which, alongside documentation of exhibitions, included more than 300 artist-donated works on canvas and paper, photographs and objects). What remains will now be held at Asia Art Archive and made available digitally too. As Roldan once explained: ‘Green Papaya will not become a self-perpetuating non-institution… working towards its death, Green Papaya is investing in possible futures.’\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Partnering with the race equality thinktank Runnymede Trust, Freelands Foundation aims to publish the report ‘on access to visual art for Black, Asian and ethnically diverse students’ in autumn 2022. The foundation has also committed £800,000 to two arts institutions, Wysing Arts Centre and the UAL Decolonising Arts Institute, which combined will support 120 artists from underrepresented backgrounds in presenting work at museums and galleries around the country. Alongside this, the non-profit supports another 15 organisations including the Arts Council, Open School East, and Create London, and has loaned £3m to the worldwide Arts & Culture Impact Fund. The Freelands Award, which gives a mid-career female artist a prize of £100,000, continues annually; this year, the prize is awarded to Jacqueline Poncelet.",

Earlier this year, Doğan told ArtReview that ‘In sexist discourses, the earth is personified as a woman’s body, becoming, like a woman’s body, something to be possessed. I draw and paint women who oppose this fate’. Her opposition has led her to serve time in prison on different occasions, and in Prison n°5, a graphic novel she released this year (and for which she was awarded the 2021 Le Soir Prize for News Report Comic Strips), she returns to her experience of incarceration at Diyarbakır prison.

Naturally the biennial operates without state support and through self-financed and self-organised infrastructures, with lowkey venues (state-run institutions are also boycotted) that (through necessity as much as choice) tend to include apartments, shopfronts, theatres and public spaces. Having started, in 2014, from nothing, OFF is now the largest independent art event in Central Europe; its third iteration, titled INHALE! and originally scheduled to take place this past April, will now happen in May 2021 and tackle the climate crisis and rise of nationalism and the things that come in between, while continuing to champion the role of art in the establishment of democratic societies.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

If these are in keeping with current curatorial fashions, they have been López’s interests for a while, from his early days running Teorética in San José, Costa Rica, and as evergreen chief champion of Cecilia Vicuña [https://artreview.com/artist/cecilia-vicuna/]. The Chilean artist was included in Toronto, marking the latest chapter in a relationship dating back to a 2019 retrospective López curated at the Witte de With (now Kunstinstituut Melly), Rotterdam, and which travelled to Mexico City, Madrid and Bogotá. Dreaming Water, a second survey of the artist’s work curated by López, opened this year at the Pinacoteca de São Paulo, following stops at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago, and MALBA, Buenos Aires. In April, López delivered the keynote lecture at the 2024 Curatorial Forum conference (organised by Independent Curators International), which focused on art and civic responsibility.",

            "‘It was clear that the economy of the art world was so different, and that conversation became very concrete.’ That’s Brown, one of New York’s most cultish art dealers, reflecting on how the cancellation of Art Basel in Basel crystallised the economic storm facing dealers, accelerating the closing of his eponymous space in Harlem this past July and his new partnership with veteran dealer Gladstone (he retains his Rome gallery). Moving with him to Gladstone’s three spaces in New York and one in Brussels is big-money painter Alex Katz (he opened a show at the Italian space in November), as well as – at the time of writing – a handful of Brown artists including Joan Jonas, Ed Atkins, Mark Leckey, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Arthur Jafa and the Jannis Kounellis estate. These cool ‘kids’ will join the tony stalwarts of the Gladstone gang, who include Thomas Hirschhorn, Anicka Yi, Shirin Neshat and Matthew Barney, the artist who put the gallery on the map at the beginning of the 1990s. Whether this new alliance is a sign of consolidation to come remains to be seen, but it creates an intriguing and powerful new force in the New York scene.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

At a point when larger Western galleries have rushed to open outposts in Asia in recent years, Lorenzo and Rillo are reversing that flow and creating a different network, with several of their artists present at this year’s Aichi, Bangkok and Istanbul triennials and biennials, as well as the Carnegie International, in Pittsburgh, alongside their Manila programme of exhibitions, which this year included a protest-inspired collaborative exhibition by Pio Abad and Stephanie Syjuco, and the bright figurative canvases of Düsseldorf-based Nicholas Grafia.",

This year the Los Angeles edition was cancelled again, and the New York fair opened in May, in a new central Manhattan location, much scaled down with just over 60 exhibitors. By the time Frieze London swung round in October however the chatter looked empty as the fair signalled a return to pre-pandemic normal with over 250 galleries setting up shop in Regent’s Park. Emanuel, CEO of parent company Endeavor, is clearly betting on the art fair’s continued relevance, green lighting the announcement of a new fair in Seoul next year. There’s some sensible precautions being taken however: having long supported the Condo London gallery swap, Frieze monetised the model with year-round gallery spaces in London’s Mayfair available for hire by out-of-town dealers.",

Patrick Sun hopes to make a difference through art. With his self-funded Sunpride Foundation, the property developer and art collector has been a formidable driving force behind LGBTQ activism in Asia. Based in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Bangkok, he has bankrolled a series of high-profile queer-focused exhibitions, Spectrosynthesis – Asian LGBTQ Issues and Art Now at the Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei in 2017, and its second iteration, Spectrosynthesis – Exposure of Tolerance: LGBTQ in Southeast Asia, at Bangkok Art and Culture Centre, in 2019. The expository titles reflect his matter-of-fact ethos: to him, art is a vehicle to raise public awareness of queer communities and to engender respect for them. Is this too straightforwardly instrumentalising art for activism? Perhaps. But in a polarised world, his support for communities that are still marginalised in many places is a breath of fresh air.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Yet it is as director of the Triangle Network that Antoniolli makes most of his global inroads, a network of over 90 artist-run spaces across 41 countries, from Britto in Bangladesh to Capacete in Brazil to Thapong in Botswana to Rybon in Iran, with whom he collaborates on secondments, fellowships and discussions, and generally shares knowledge.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

In 15 years the Rajas have not only built and established two galleries in the city and a third in Mumbai, but also an entire ecosystem, created through the Experimenter Curators’ Hub, which held its 14th edition this year; their online learning-orientated Experimenter Labs; Experimenter Books; an outpost exhibition programme that ‘inhabits disused, characterful spaces’; and the Generator Co-operative Art Production Fund, which offers small bursaries for art production. TRI opened with solo shows by Experimenter artists Prabhakar Pachpute and Kallol Datta, while at the same time during Mumbai Gallery Weekend the Rajas staged exhibitions by Afrah Shafiq and Alexandra Bachzetsis, and camp’s monumental 2022 seven-channel installation Bombay Tilts Down could be seen in the open air down at the city’s docks.

            "Following the city’s reassessment of what kind of place Kunsthalle Wien should be, the three members of WHW directing the institution (Ivet Ćurlin, Nataša Ilić and Sabina Sabolović) found themselves without a contract renewal [https://artreview.com/curatorial-collective-what-how-for-whom-forced-out-of-kunsthalle-wien/] in June (Ana Dević is the fourth member). City Hall’s disapproval apparently related to an exhibition programme that lacked tourist-friendly crowd-pleasers (2024 shows included solos for tech-focused sculptor Aleksandra Domanović and experimental filmmaker Diego Marcon [https://artreview.com/diego-marcons-hollow-people/]), as well as poor visitor numbers (though WHW’s tenure coincided with the pandemic). The termination of WHW’s employment caused one member of the institution’s board to quit; meanwhile, the trio left a valedictory postscript in the form of a 62m mural by Nora Turato reading, ‘Aaaaaaaa…!!!!!!’ – the first of an annual public artwork commission established during WHW’s time in office. They won’t be dwelling on the past, though: WHW’s departure gives them more time to prepare for the 2027 edition of Skulptur Projekte Münster. Their appointment as the first female curators of the exhibition was announced [https://artreview.com/what-how-for-whom-to-direct-skulptur-projekte-munster-2027/] in August.",

            "‘Neutrality is a fiction’ when it comes to institutions, says Raicovich; it is a guise, as she makes clear in her forthcoming book Culture Strike (2021), for the defence of white male hegemony. In 2018 she left the directorship of the Queens Museum, New York, specifically objecting to the Israeli government hiring the museum for an event featuring US vice president Mike Pence, and more generally in dispute with a board that wanted to quell her political engagement. She is currently interim director at New York’s Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, dedicated to queer culture, where she has addressed in the programming (albeit remotely) how queerness intersects with race and class. But her real power lies in her readiness to engage in debate, most recently instigating a series of hot-topic Zoom discussions with curator Helen Molesworth – ‘an experiment in talking and listening’ – that kicked off with a conversation on the Philip Guston controversy and included Coco Fusco, Charles Gaines, Nikki Columbus and any of the over 450 people who signed up and wished to chip in. \n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Its model is simple: offer training programmes in film- and image-making entirely tuition-free, in a bid to open up the elitist world of art and cinema to underrepresented voices. The key to its success is the school’s network – Ly has since been joined by street artist JR and actress Ludivine Sagnier, while guest lecturers include George Lucas and Spike Lee – which is there to ensure a smooth professional transition for its students as well as exciting opportunities: this year’s students put on their own group show at Palais de Tokyo, which drew crowds in August, and some of their work is currently on view at Galleria Continua in Les Moulins, east of Paris. A recent partnership with Netflix for the next few years is likely to bolster the school’s ongoing expansion: Kourtrajmé Marseille, which opened this autumn, and a forthcoming school in Dakar.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Then its art fairs in Hong Kong, Basel and Miami were cancelled (or went online; ‘It doesn’t work,’ dealer Dominique Lévy summed up), precipitating a ten percent staff loss at Art Basel. So there was a lot riding on 2021, especially now that Art Basel global director Spiegler has the backing of Murdoch’s Lupa Systems investment vehicle, MCH’s ‘anchor shareholder’. Hong Kong, though delayed, went off without a hitch (a relief given that Spiegler had promised full refunds if the fair was cancelled), and the Swiss edition was judged a slow but steady success, despite the notable absence of American collectors. Spiegler had enticed 272 galleries with a 10 percent discount, a promise to cover hotel quarantines and a CHF1.5m (£1.2m) ‘solidarity relief fund’ for those disappointed by sales (97 galleries took up the offer). Miami returns with 254 exhibitors, roughly its prepandemic level. Murdoch’s art interest goes beyond booths: this year he invested in an art-focused NFT marketplace.",

            "Upending the classics seems to be the theme this year for the multidisciplinary artist, who embraces a state of in-betweenness both in terms of personal identity and in the mediums of her projects, which variously include filmmaking, performance and installation. Over the past five years she has been scandalising conservative critics and audiences at the stately Swiss theatre Schauspielhaus Zürich in her role as a guest director by staging avant-garde updates to canonical works including Orpheus (2021), Pinocchio (2022) and The Tempest (2024), while increasing gender and racial diversity in the productions. (The magnificent Moby-Dick; or, The Whale [https://artreview.com/wu-tsang-of-whales-thyssen-bornemisza-museo-nacional-madrid-moby-dick-review/], 2022, a silent film retelling Herman Melville’s novel, premiered there, and has since travelled the world to acclaim.) Together with her longtime collaborators, the open collective Moved by the Motion, Wu closed her stint at the Schauspielhaus with a hybrid operatic-theatrical take on Georges Bizet’s 1875 Carmen. The show received mixed reviews – but judging by the upcoming touring schedule of Wu’s projects, she’ll be keeping busy.",

            "Based between his hometown of Lubumbashi and since 2010 his adoptive home of Brussels, Baloji mines the ramifications of Belgian colonisation and extractivism in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. His research culminated in a survey show this year at Goldsmiths CCA in London, which featured, among other things, a new commission that drew connections between extraction and Belgian art nouveau, and a collaborative performance that recounted the story of the first Black bishop appointed by the Catholic Church in the fifteenth century. But Baloji’s actual power lies in his role as a catalyst for his hometown’s art scene: as a cofounder of an independent association that supports local artists, Atelier Picha, he has been instrumental in establishing the Lubumbashi Biennale, which launched its 8th edition in October under the title Towards an Antidote to Toxicity. Focusing on the legacy of Congolese thinker Valentin-Yves Mudimbe, this year’s iteration seeks to imagine the possibilities of anticolonial engagement with the colonial archive through the works of artists from across the country and beyond.",

Dean, who in December last year was promoted to editor and curator of Rhizome, the digital platform affiliated with the New Museum, is a vocal conscience for the artworld, unafraid to delve into whatever culture-war skirmish dominates the art press at a given time. That commentary is underpinned by a thoughtful theoretical framework, summed up during a presentation she gave at the MMK Frankfurt, when she asked, ‘Do we have an adequate politic of looking and being looked at?’ Dean was talking specifically then about digital culture, but her work on Black representation, on structural and economic oppression, parlayed in her sculpture (seen this year at the MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, and soon as part of Made in LA 2020 at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles), writing and numerous other public-speaking engagements, encapsulates the same urgent query.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

In March Essers supported a show of Lindokuhle Sobekwa’s photographs at the Johannesburg Art Gallery; while the Cape Town space held exhibitions for multimedia artists Mikhael Subotzky and Alfredo Jaar. The London gallery opened a survey of the late painter Atta Kwami, which moved to the New York space, complementing its inaugural full year of programming, featuring Misheck Masamvu, Zineb Sedira and Kapwani Kiwanga, among others. Meanwhile, visitors to the Cheetah Plains luxury safari lodge on the Sabi Sand Nature Reserve may have gone for the lions and leopards, but could stay for the art: in January it opened a private art gallery in partnership with Goodman Gallery, to the delight of its the wildlife-hungry holidaymakers.",

He’s also a stylist whose steady stream of digestibly short, aphorism-filled books pair well with social media-tinged attention spans. Titling his 2023 book Via Contemplativa: In Praise of Inactivity might seem a little at odds, coming from such a prolific writer, though it’s a paean to the unhurried contemplation of reality, rather than commendation for doing nothing at all. And if said reality gives you the shivers, this year the Korean-German thinker published the Anselm Kiefer-illustrated The Spirit of Hope – ‘a plea against the crisis of fear’ by the same writer who also in 2024 put out The Crisis of Narration, which lamented the loss of richly complex storytelling and the social media-fuelled shift towards ‘storyselling’. Problems everywhere, then, but it’s all grist to Han’s fast-moving diagnostic mill.",

We chose not to inherit this model,’ stated the Carcross/Tagish First Nation curator and educator upon accepting the Skowhegan Vanguard Award this October. Hopkins was speaking as executive director and chief curator at Forge Project, New York, which this year transitioned from a private foundation to a nonprofit, with an Indigenous steering council including artists Sky Hopinka and Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/]. While Forge holds its own collection, its programme is one led not by exhibitions but residencies, community days, discussion events and collaborative meals, shaping what an art institution can become from an Indigenous perspective. Meanwhile, Hopkins [https://artreview.com/forge-project-indigenous-self-determination-reimagining-art-pedagogy-candice-hopkins-shanna-ketchum-heap-of-birds-interview/] also secured a $175,000 grant for climate action from the Teiger Foundation, curated a show at the Nanaimo Art Gallery in her home territory of British Columbia and continued as Fellow in Indigenous Art History and Curatorial Studies at CCS Bard.",

Art isn’t always far from these, though with the conclusion of its ‘Transformations of the Human’ programme last year (which supported artist fellows such as Ian Cheng and Anicka Yi), the art-focus has taken a step back (that programme has been spun off into an independent organisation). Though Berggruen’s huge Herzog & de Meuron-designed ‘scholar’s campus’ project in the Santa Monica Mountains has yet to break ground, the institute’s Venice satellite space is now up and running, and in March Berggruen acquired a second palazzo, the future base for Berggruen Arts & Culture, scheduled to open in 2024, with Sterling Ruby currently artist-in-residence.",

This year’s edition was speedily reworked in light of the pandemic. Paranoia TV, launched in September, is a slick online operation, packed with binge-worthy works that lived up to the curator’s promise of ‘Netflix but less lonely’. Ingo Niermann’s Deutsch Süd-Ost (2020), tracking a fictional future far-right coup, unfolds over 25 parts; Brazilian artist Tamar Guimarães (collaborating with Luisa Cavanagh and Rusi Millán Pastori) created an ‘anti-Bolsonaro-WhatsApp-Soap’ running for four episodes. The Graz public experienced physical works also, integrated into the public realm, from newspaper interventions (obituaries for outdated notions) by Sung Tieu, a soundwork by Lawrence Abu Hamdan hidden in crisp packets at local supermarkets and a broadcast on taxi radios by Janez Janša that imagines the European Football Championship if it hadn’t been postponed.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

On the Boston waterfront the artist placed Last Garment (2022), a bronze sculpture based on a nineteenth-century Jamaican washerwoman. The exhibition travelled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, in November, and a new edition of another Venice work by Leigh, Sentinel (2022), entered the collection of the city’s National Gallery of Art in August.

This year, exhibitions (developed out of the institution’s residency programme) by Otobong Nkanga and Zheng Bo have tackled the subjects of humanity’s relationship to nature, exploitative extraction processes, structures of repair and ‘how plants practice politics’. The last was a typically innovative experiment by Rosenthal, who before Berlin had the 2016 Sydney Biennale and a curatorial role at the Hayward Gallery, London, to her name; an approach that has reestablished the century-old institution’s relevance since her arrival in 2018. Earlier this year, Rosenthal cocurated a very prescient performance programme exploring ‘rituals of care’, as part of the global project CONNECT, BTS by K-pop band and international sensation BTS; and when the pandemic came, she found innovative ways to make a solo show by Lee Mingwei, at which visitor-activation and tactility were central, COVID-19-safe.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Yet lest anyone think the election result was a win for antiracism, Ligon noted in Artforum that ‘the emergency started generations ago for Indigenous people who resided here before the colonizers arrived, and for the enslaved Africans brought to these shores over four hundred years ago’. Ligon has become the go-to chronicler of America in crisis, producing sculpture, painting and writing on Black history, the African-American experience and racial injustice. As the Black Lives Matter protests swept the world, images of his art proliferated on social media (including in posts by several museums, which Ligon criticised for not having asked permission). As well as participating in a dozen group shows, Ligon has been a curatorial adviser for Grief and Grievance: Art and Mourning in America (due to open at the New Museum in January), an exhibition conceived by the late curator Okwui Enwezor and realised posthumously. And, when a doomed exhibition of work by Philip Guston’s art needed contextualising, Ligon was the go-to writer.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "‘Public art is propaganda,’ the American artist said at the end of last year. ‘White men on horses looking down on us.’ Thomas is pushing marginalised narratives to the fore. In July, at the BeltLine Eastside Trail in Atlanta, the artist installed an 8.5m-tall sculpture of an Afro pick, titled All Power to All People, which then toured Washington, DC, and Philadelphia, and will later be on show in Los Angeles and Chicago in 2021. In the immediate leadup to the US elections, he launched Wide Awakes, marches characterised by the creativity of costumes and banner art, which encouraged Black voting and rallied against voter suppression. Just as ambitious was a new initiative by For Freedoms, the collective cofounded by the artist, in which more than 70 politically minded peers, including Ai Weiwei, Christine Sun Kim and the Guerrilla Girls, made work for billboards across America to mark Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Indoors, the artist had solo shows at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, in Bentonville, Arkansas, and Kayne Griffin Corcoran, Los Angeles. Thomas’ work is currently on show at Jack Shainman Gallery’s The School, in Kinderhook, NY.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

The new 2046 Fermentation + Fellowships programme, awarded to 18 young Hong Kong artists, includes reciprocal learning and support sessions and invites participants to apply for individual grants of HK$20,000 to realise a proposal. Meanwhile, Para Site’s NoExit Grant for Unpaid Artistic Labour continues into its second year: 28 Filipino artists received HK$20,000 each for unconditional use. It was business-as-usual programming this year. A long-running open call for emerging curators produced Alvin Li and Junyuan Feng’s Liquid Ground; an institutional tie-up with Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum resulted in Curtains; and a solo exhibition by Hong Kong-based artist Luke Ching Chin Wai questioned wider structures in society. Meanwhile, Costinas’s postponed edition of the Kathmandu Triennale is scheduled to take place this coming February.",

            "Alongside his painting, Burrows has long been interested in the fraught economics of being an artist – he has previously run mentoring schemes on just this. So when commissions, sales and teaching gigs were cancelled globally this year, he came up with a simple hashtag and proposal. Under #artistsupportpledge, artists post work for sale on Instagram, priced at under £200/$200 depending on the region. If the artist sells five works, they promise to in turn purchase from another artist using the same scheme. From its launch in mid-March through to today, the DIY project has exploded, with close to half a million works offered direct from studios, an estimated £60m in sales (as of August) and press coverage stretching from Malaysia to America, Denmark to India. It was, Burrows says, a way of creating a rapid economy based on a ‘culture of generosity’, while also proving that the artworld’s gatekeepers and power structures can be circumvented. For his efforts, Burrows has been awarded an MBE by the British government.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Much of Scott’s work has involved looking at historical models of how ‘powerless’ or subaltern groups achieve agency and the strategies they use to do it. Weapons of the Weak (1985) examined everyday forms of resistance; Seeing Like a State (1998) argued that state attempts to make a people legible (by categorising them) makes them more easily manipulable; The Art of Not Being Governed (2009) looked at resistance to cultural assimilation in the uplands of Southeast Asia, arguing that minority groups used vernacular knowledge and ‘their culture… to put distance between themselves and the states that wished to engulf them’. His work has influenced writers such as Legacy Russell, curators such as Anselm Franke, and artists such as Liu Chuang and Ho Tzu Nyen, and protest movements worldwide.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

In terms of physical exhibitions Learning What Can’t Be Taught is about art education in China from the 1950s to 2000s. Online, Life Lessons hosted conversations between artists exploring the moments of learning that influenced their practices. And AAA continues to plug the gaps in Asian art history through crowdsourced projects like Wikipedia edit-a-thons. Since joining AAA in 2017, Tain has continued to broaden its international links, through research projects like Connecting Modern Art Histories in and across Africa, South and Southeast Asia, which culminated at this year’s Dhaka Art Summit, and further deepened its collecting focus, including the launch of two new archives – the Philippines’ Green Papaya Art Projects and Thailand’s Womanifesto.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

In 2023, while continuing to sit on the board of KW Institute, Stoschek oversaw shows by underknown septuagenarian Black video artist Ulysses Jenkins and emerging South Korean multimedia artist Young-jun Tak, a six-decade survey of video-based performance art and a Hans Ulrich Obrist-curated exploration of the intersection between art and videogames. Meanwhile, after a 2022 marred by revelations of her great-grandfather’s wartime involvement with the Nazi Party, this year Stoschek sought to redirect the narrative forwards, her foundation announcing a long-term resource-sharing collaboration with the Düsseldorf Art Academy. For someone so frequently invested in art’s present and near future, it’s an on-brand move.",

With a new Basel address and a second London space opening next year, Hauser & Wirth, run by husband and wife Iwan and Manuela, alongside Payot as president, will shortly equal Gagosian’s real estate. It is ‘a whole world you step into’, consultant Barbara Guggenheim told the Financial Times. She was not just talking about a global reach that spans from Hollywood to Hong Kong to Gstaad to New York, nor the 103 artists and artists’ estates the gallery promotes (veterans William Kentridge, Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/] and Nairy Baghramian joined the roster this year, as well as youngster George Rouy and Michaela Yearwood-Dan). The trio have also established themselves as lifestyle purveyors via their ‘art centres’ in Somerset and Menorca, and, above all, through Iwan and Manuela’s loss-leading Artfarm hospitality company, which owns restaurants, hotels, pubs and, not least, London’s Groucho Club, all adorned with the work of gallery artists. If, as one cynic put it, also to the FT, ‘galleries are event organisers for rich and lonely people’, then Hauser & Wirth definitely fills the void.",

Smaller destroyed artefacts were recreated at Jane Lombard Gallery in New York in January. Previously, he’s staged dinners served on plates looted from Saddam Hussein’s palaces and run a truck serving food cooked by Iraqi immigrants and American veterans. Last year he withdrew from the Whitney Biennial in protest over board member Warren Kanders’s connections to the arms industry. This year he got into a spat with MoMA PS1 after the curators of a group show, Theater of Operations: The Gulf Wars, 1991–2011, refused his request to pause his work in protest over trustees Larry Fink’s and Leon Black’s financial links to, respectively, the operation of private prisons and a defence contractor responsible for the 2007 massacre of 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad. On being told this, Rakowitz took direct action, wandering into the show with a remote and pausing his video himself.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Mbembe’s most recent book, The Earthly Community (2022), presents the bleak trajectory of technocapitalism, but also posits a possible escape route through African cosmologies and the power of African aesthetics and figurative objects. The author has been touring his book globally and received rave reviews for his radical call for an African future: in June he gave a lecture at the University of Bergen (while receiving the Holberg Prize, the first African to do so), and in November he was billed as the star attraction of the biennial Maputo Fast Forward Festival. In São Paulo for the 9th International Theatre Festival, he told Veja that ‘we must fight to ensure that no person of African descent is a stranger in Africa’, arguing that the continent should institute a right of return.",

The postponement of a touring Philip Guston retrospective, due to open in London in February, amid sensitivities over the late artist’s use of Ku Klux Klan motifs, caused an almighty furore. Balshaw, director of Tate’s four sites, and Morris, director of Tate Modern, denied self-censorship, claiming in The Times that their institutional partners’ ‘credibility among black and minority ethnic audiences is at stake’. Tate Modern senior curator Mark Godfrey broke ranks, posting on Instagram that the decision was ‘extremely patronising to viewers’. For that he got suspended, as Tate’s corporate machine kicked into gear. It missed a step, however, while navigating another scandal, regarding an ‘amusing’ mural featuring depictions of slavery in Tate Britain’s restaurant. Meanwhile, the galleries manoeuvred between lockdowns to stage exhibitions for Steve McQueen, Zanele Muholi and Bruce Nauman at Tate Modern, Don McCullin at Tate Liverpool and Haegue Yang at Tate St Ives. The COVID-19 closure took its toll: 313 restaurant, shop and publishing staff got the chop.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "When Kaphar was commissioned by Time magazine in 2014 to create Yet Another Fight for Remembrance – a painting commemorating the protests and activism coming out of Ferguson, Missouri, in the aftermath of Michael Brown’s killing by the police – he was well on his way to wider recognition. That commission arose out of a Time editor’s trip to The Studio Museum in Harlem and the viewing of Kaphar’s The Jerome Project, a portrait-based investigation of incarceration and Kaphar’s own family history. In 2018 Kaphar won a MacArthur ‘genius’ grant and mounted a solo show at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC. Last year he, along with artist Jonathan Brand and financier Jason Price, established NXTHVN, an innovative and entrepreneurship-focused incubator and mentorship organisation serving artists, curators and students of colour. And when Gagosian announced Kaphar’s representation in October (his paintings are currently on show at one of the gallery’s New York spaces), the artist made sure it came with an endorsement of his nonprofit.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "‘When I was little, I understood that my thoughts were different, and I decided not to live colonized,’ the Chilean artist told Casa Vogue this year. Vicuña suffered as a result, for decades often at the brink of destitution but continuing nonetheless with her knotted textile sculptures, agitprop paintings and poetry. Now the world is eager to listen, what with the eco-feminist and Indigenous turn in artmaking that Vicuña’s work has always embodied. Dreaming Water, one of several recent retrospectives, which opened in Santiago and Buenos Aires last year, arrived at the Pinacoteca of São Paulo in May, while Pérez Art Museum Miami installed a nine-metre quipus, one of the artist’s cascading sculptures of unspun wool. Her work was present in 15 group shows this year, including Pacific Standard Time, California, and two biennials (Malta and Toronto). In addition, the artist presented spoken word performances at venues including Triple Canopy, New York; Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; and Tate Britain, London. In November, Vicuña was awarded $100,000 as a recipient [https://artreview.com/julian-charriere-and-cecilia-vicuna-win-inaugural-environment-and-art-prize/] of the inaugural MoCA Los Angeles Eric and Wendy Schmidt Environment and Art Prize.",

            "Feral Atlas is a five-year curatorial project by Anna L. Tsing, Jennifer Deger, Alder Keleman Saxena and Feifei Zhou, involving a collective of over 100 scientists, humanists and artists who seek to examine the ‘un-designed effects of human infrastructures’ and which has culminated with the recent release of the interactive digital platform Feral Atlas: The More-than-Human Anthropocene. The platform – a playful, political and poetic attempt to draw our attention to the formation of ‘feral’ dynamics (ecologies that have been encouraged by human-built infrastructures but have developed and spread beyond human control) – combines imaginative mapping systems with scientific findings and artistic representation. While Feral Atlas featured in the 2018 Istanbul Biennial and last year’s Sharjah Architecture Triennial, the Atlas online suggests some of the power of putting diverse thinkers and makers from around the globe on a platform that goes beyond the usual limitations of physical place and intellectual disciplines – a form of networked collaboration that may be key to grasping the age of the Anthropocene and our current ecological crisis.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "This research group, founded in 2010 by Israeli architect Eyal Weizman [https://artreview.com/eyal-weizman-why-aesthetics-must-mean-more-than-beauty/] and consisting of over 20 artists, architects, journalists and researchers who investigate human rights violations, has never been busier. The group has long worked in Palestine, and in January the first exhibition of its Ramallah-based offshoot, the Forensic Architecture Investigation (FAI) Unit, was staged at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Arts and Sciences. The exhibition displayed its trademark analysis of found field recordings, media imagery and satellite pictures, as well as 3D animated reconstructions used to create second-by-second retellings of contested events. The unit, set up in 2020, is a collaboration with Al-Haq, a human rights organisation, but one that has been designated a terrorist group by Israel’s Ministry of Defense, and Forensic Architecture has been the subject of much criticism from commentators, particularly in Germany. Shows at Württembergische Kunstverein Stuttgart and Museum im Kulturspeicher (MiK), Würzburg, both concerning racist and anti-immigration violence in Germany, went ahead, however.\n\nThe methodology they pioneered, in applying aesthetic analysis to news and events, has proven widely influential, while affiliates and former members, including artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan [https://artreview.com/artist/lawrence-abu-hamdan/] and curator Anselm Franke, have spread this further in their own work. Positioning artistic tools and interdisciplinary creative research as means to generate evidence of what they term ‘state and corporate violence’, their work’s proposal of art as something that can be instrumentalised is apparently an alluring one for many artists, suggesting art installation as antidote to an image-dominated, post-truth landscape. The current show at CIVA, Brussels, shows their 2023 work on prehistoric architecture in what is now Ukraine; their work on former plantations in Louisiana, USA, becoming petrochemical factories on view at the Wellcome Collection, London; and a selection of their ongoing work on medical staff in Gaza over the past year being exhibited in Vienna. Alongside museum exhibitions also in Istanbul, Portland and Cali, and biennials in Rotterdam and Yogyakarta, their work continues to have both global focus and audiences.",

Funding arts programmes has long been a focus within that framework: in 2024 alone this has ranged from the $1.1m the foundation gave to bankroll Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/]’s pavilion at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] (Gibson was the first Indigenous artist to represent the US at the event), to the $500k each given to the Los Angeles Museum of Art, New York’s The Kitchen and the Whitney (specifically for the exhibition of choreographer and Civil Rights activist Alvin Ailey), and the $2k given to National Portrait Gallery staffers to attend a migrant justice conference.

Her reach is wide: a new Japanese translation of the writer, thinker and cultural historian’s 2006 book Lose Your Mother won Japan’s Best Translation Award this year. All of this continues to spread her work and her influential methods of delving into archives, exploring their gaps and absences, and reanimating them with both academic rigor and the tools of fiction, what she refers to as ‘critical fabulation’. Her aim in 2019’s Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments [https://artreview.com/can-there-be-history-without-facts-feature-izabella-scott/#:~:text=The%20US%20scholar%20Saidiya%20Hartman], as she wrote, of ‘reconstructing the experience of the unknown and retrieving minor lives from oblivion’ could also be read as a guide for many artists working today.\n\nThis year, while teaching in the English Department at Columbia University and continuing work on a book about unsung heroes of Black radicalism (under the title Graces of the Unsung), and alongside her inclusion in the publication Five Manifestos for the Beautiful World (2024, based on a lecture series from last year), Hartman resumed her ongoing collaboration with artist Arthur Jafa [https://artreview.com/artist/arthur-jafa/?year=2020] through an ambitious three-part multimedia performance, Minor Music at the End of the World. Commissioned by Hartwig Art Foundation and currently in rehearsal, with theorist Tina Campt involved as dramaturg, the production is based on two of Hartman’s essays, ‘The End of White Supremacy: An American Romance’ and ‘Litany for Grieving Sisters’. It also draws on the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, particularly his science fiction story ‘The Comet’, published in 1920 in the wake of the Great Influenza pandemic, in which a black man and a white woman are the sole survivors of an apocalyptic event. Hartman and Jafa’s work will premiere in Amsterdam next year, and the questions it promises to raise testify to Hartman’s conceptual scope and hopefulness: ‘How does one live at the end of the world? Is it possible to envision a world without racism? And what would be required to produce such a world?’",

            "The power of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, launched back in 2013 by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, continues to be felt at every level of the artworld and with an increased prominence and urgency in 2020: in the resurgence of statue-toppling in the US and across Europe, as campaigners seek to redress injustices of the historical record; in the visibility of Black figurative painting over the past few years; in awards and appointments; in the rush by galleries to diversify their rosters; in the belated attempts to decolonise collections and in the deaccessioning that might make it possible; in the postponement of Philip Guston Now; or in the Whitney’s bungling of an exhibition about the protests. Both an explicit movement and a dispersed idea, BLM has come to symbolise a global reckoning on racial justice and a paradigm shift in contemporary culture. What started as a protest against police brutality in the United States has catalysed movements from Britain to South Africa, dramatically reshaping the cultural landscape within which the international artworld operates. And as it spreads around the world of art, it impacts on how everyone makes work, displays collections and exhibitions, and engages with the public. In the process it has triggered a self-reckoning, a consideration of our own biases, complicities and allyships.\n\nBlack Lives Matter, and the Movement for Black Lives network of which it is a part, is distinguished from single-issue predecessors like the antiapartheid coalition by the intensity of its attention towards both the obvious and the oft-ignored structures of power that generate inequality. And so, on the principle that the values of a society are enshrined in the culture it valorises, museums have found themselves at the centre of fierce debates around representation, identity and the reproduction of injustice. Operating as a network of affiliated interests rather than a top-down hierarchy, Black Lives Matter also provides a method for a decentralised, decolonised and more equitable artworld. More importantly, it’s an ongoing working-through of historical imbalances, incorporating discussion, redressal and a recognition that we can change how we all work and structure things. That’s the promise, but there is still a lot of work to be done.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

They opened the Muholi Art Institute in Cape Town last year, offering residencies lasting six months to a year, with a stipend, housing and studio costs covered; the fruits of which were featured in an exhibition at Jonathan Carver Moore gallery in San Francisco in June. In February the institute presented a group exhibition, EMBODYING #HER, spotlighting the work of established and emerging women-identifying and queer artists.",

In October, Show Me the Monet, a take on the impressionist painter’s Water Lilies series, sold for a record £7.5m at auction. Prints Banksy stopped making in 2010 now command six-figure sums. Against establishment antipathy, others have reason to appreciate mystery-man’s success. In the summer MV Louise Michel was launched, a former French Customs boat refitted as a search-and-rescue vessel to assist migrants in peril on the Mediterranean, funded and decorated by Banksy. An exhibition of photographs of the artist’s work in Palestine was unveiled in August, a gesture recognising the diversified tourism to the state his stencil work has brought. One looming problem: in September the artist lost his battle to trademark his designs, in part because of his anonymity.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

This year, Cezar could also be seen across the world, from a talks programme in India to a gin brand launch during Hong Kong’s Art Week: not only is he scouting for talent, but also on the lookout for £7m, the amount needed to secure the institution’s future since the death of its patron and founder, Delfina Entrecanales, in 2022.

The programme was organised as a collaboration between the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, where Andrew is adjunct curator, and the University of Melbourne, where he is ‘director of reimagining museums and collections’, and where he founded BLAK C.O.R.E., a collective driven by First Nations methodologies, research and cultural practice. Andrew continues as artistic associate of the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, where he is curating a show on global Indigeneity in 2026. There was also a public lightwork for Footscray, a suburb of Melbourne, featuring Andrew’s trademark black-and-white Op-art patterning; and preparations are underway for a second architectural commission, next to Sydney Central station. Now represented by Sydney- and Singapore-based Ames Yavuz, he had a show earlier in the year at Frieze’s No. 9 Cork Street gallery in London, alongside Pinaree Sanpitak.",

That move, along with Macgregor’s innovative and savvy programming of exhibitions and public events, has made it the most visited contemporary art museum in the world, according to a report published last year. Like most arts institutions the MCA’s running was largely restricted by health measures and lockdowns, yet it had time to host the 2020 Brook Andrew-curated Biennale of Sydney and a major retrospective of Chinese-Australian artist Lindy Lee, which Macgregor hopes will attract domestic tourists (so does the government, which backed the show via its tourism and major events agency Destination NSW). Macgregor’s reputation on the national level was further confirmed when the government, after failing to implement the $250m arts bailout package announced in June, brought her in to lead a ‘creative economy taskforce’ to advise on its allocation.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

How does that square with a country likely to feel the effects of the climate emergency most sharply? It is something the summit addressed head-on with works, curated by Campbell, ranging from Joydeb Roaja’s largescale immersive installation addressing environmental displacement to puppetry performances by children that reflected on climate change. The Samdanis are also establishing the Srihatta, their permanent foundation and sculpture park in rural Bangladesh, delayed but set to open to the public and for artist residencies next year. Away from Bangladesh, Nadia received the Order of Arts and Letters from French Ministry of Culture, and Campbell took control of Desert X in the Coachella Valley in March, again on the climatic beat, linking droughts and floods in California and Bangladesh.",

            "In January the investigation convened by Documenta [https://artreview.com/category/news/documenta/] into ruangrupa’s 2022 edition of the exhibition found it ‘served as an echo chamber for Israel-related antisemitism and sometimes pure antisemitism’, but also defended artistic freedom. If the Indonesian collective hoped to return to lives not under constant scrutiny – no such luck: Documenta put out apologetic statements after two members ‘liked’ a social media post depicting a pro-Palestine celebration the day of Hamas’s attack on Israel (Reza Afisina and Iswanto Hartono, both currently visiting professors at the University of Fine Arts Hamburg, also apologised, saying they mistakenly thought the video showed police breaking up the demonstration). Despite the controversies, and while less overtly and creatively active this year, their mode of nonhierarchical working is spreading, both through inspiration and ongoing collaborations: Momentum 12 [https://artreview.com/momentum-12-announces-participating-artists/], the Norwegian biennial, made explicit reference to their project by including the archives of Gudskul, the free art school the collective operates in Jakarta, as did Asia Art Archive’s exhibition The Collective School.",

            "Three years have passed since Sarr and Savoy published their report advocating the unconditional restitution of African cultural heritage, originally commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron. If the report quickly became an influential framework for institutions across Europe to grapple with the colonial legacies within their collections, it is now starting to bear tangible fruits, with multiple Western institutions and governments (committing to) returning artefacts acquired through force, clandestine excavation, corruption or theft. Most notably, Germany and Nigeria signed a memorandum of understanding concerning 1,100 artefacts held in German ethnological museums to go on display in a new institution in Benin City, designed by David Adjaye. Meanwhile, in France the report’s influence was felt throughout the historical Africa-France Summit, convened by Macron under the leadership of Achille Mbembe. If some critics dismiss these gestures as moves to cultivate soft power in former colonies, they still constitute concrete steps towards the decolonialisation of Western institutions and the cultural reappropriation of African heritage.",

Her 1988 essay ‘Can the Subaltern Speak?’, which tackled problems of representation and agency in formerly colonised countries, continues to be a key point of reference within postcolonial studies, and in recent years her influence has grown beyond academia and into an artworld that is attempting to decolonise its practices and institutions, becoming a lodestone for curators and artists working in the field. Advocating for the importance of the humanities in the redress of the economically dispossessed and marginalised, Spivak also runs the Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty Memorial Rural Education Project, which she founded in 1986 to fund and provide high standards of teaching in primary schools in her home state of West Bengal. She is currently a professor at Columbia University, where she cofounded the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

While the walls of the museum back then were dominated by art by white people, Joyner is determined to use the wealth she has accrued through a career in finance to collect and lend the work of Black artists. This year Joyner donated 31 paintings, sculptures and drawings by 20 American artists from the African diaspora to SFMoMA (where she is a trustee, alongside board positions at MoMA, the J. Paul Getty Trust, Tate Americas and the Chicago Art Institute). The works were selected by Joyner to plug gaps in SFMoMA’s collection, offering new, more inclusive readings of art history. ‘What I want visitors to take away is that there were people of colour not only working in the field,’ Joyner said this year, ‘but defining the character of the movement at that time.’",

While her videos, performances and, most recently, virtual reality works continue to speak to technological progress and the transformation of China, it is the human experience in all of this that fascinates her the most – and has led to her staying power. ‘I come from the pre-internet era,’ she has said, ‘and what moves me is the relationship formed through emotions, people, objects and the world, not only algorithms and data.’ It is this broadness in her curiosity that registers with audiences, not least those visiting the Lenbachhaus in Munich, where her work explored the relationship between digital culture and the real and virtual worlds. The artist also had solo exhibitions at SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (where the artist transformed the galleries into, for example, a Beijing cinema foyer and a yum cha restaurant, with the help of Hong Kong-based Beau Architects) and Museum of Art Pudong in Shanghai, the last being Cao’s largest to date.",

            "The philosopher and curator [https://artreview.com/the-interview-paul-b-preciado-orlando-virginia-woolf/] made his first foray into film with his experimental production Orlando, My Political Biography (2023), which gained wider theatrical releases throughout 2024. ‘A political work that wears its seriousness very lightly,’ wrote Sight and Sound, ‘and its lightness very seriously indeed.’ Preciado’s book Dysphoria Mundi, published in Spanish in 2023, will come out in an English translation in early 2025 (the hybrid essayistic outing was written during the COVID-19 lockdown and considers dysphoria as a defining aspect of current life). But Preciado remains, as ever, the intellectual face for the instabilities of gender and biopolitics, and a world that’s in transition. Often cited by artists, Preciado’s work made its way into the Spanish Pavilion [https://artreview.com/venice-biennale-2024-a-guide-to-the-giardini/#:~:text=dense%20and%20captivating-,Spain%20Pavilion,-presents%20hundreds%20of] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] this year, where Sandra Gamarra [https://artreview.com/sandra-gamarra-heshiki-on-representing-spain-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] took a sentence from a lecture by the thinker to accompany a work she had made: ‘trans body is to normative heterosexuality what Palestine is to the West: a colony whose extension and form is perpetuated only through violence’.",

            "‘The greatest love that the human species has attained was on a Gucci shoot, when I was shooting a trans couple making love,’ Goldin proclaimed in October. After the pain of her opioid addiction, and the crusade to bring down the Sackler family (museum patrons who made their fortune through the prescription opioid Oxycontin), the photographer was rewarded with a campaign for the fashion brand (an emotional moment, apparently, featuring the likes of Debbie Harry). Alongside her first big-bucks commercial deal was a show of older work presented by Gagosian at the Welsh Chapel in London, while her dealer’s New York space premiered two of her newest moving image works: the apocalyptic You never did anything wrong, in which the models are all animals, and Stendhal Syndrome (both 2024), which pairs personal photographs with portraits of masterpieces from famous museums (now devoid of Sackler sponsorship, naturally). Does this represent a mellowing? Not at all: in October Goldin was arrested outside the New York Stock Exchange [https://artreview.com/nan-goldin-among-artists-arrested-at-jewish-voice-for-peace-action/] while protesting Israel’s bombardment of Palestine.",

This year found the 2020 MacArthur genius-grant awardee taking time out from lecturing on performance studies at NYU (as well as his fellowship at Harvard and other-coast gig at UC Riverside) to lecture on subjects including the poetics of W.E.B. Du Bois and to participate in the Harvard conference ‘Jews and Black Theory: Conceptualizing Otherness’. (In a report on the latter, his performance-inflected keynote was described as a talk that ‘defies summarizing’.) But Moten, who has historically collaborated with artists such as Wu Tsang [https://artreview.com/artist/wu-tsang/], is himself as much a creative maker as a parser of ideas. In 2024, in addition to giving onstage poetry readings (he’s now published ten books of verse), he released and gigged the blacksmiths, the flowers, his second album alongside jazz rhythm section Brandon López and Gerald Cleaver, with Moten – who else – taking care of the words.",

This last triggered the sacking of Gagosian director Sam Orlofsky after it published various allegations against the gallerist (who has not responded).

While her Biennale remains a touchstone of how to handle a largescale, in-depth exhibition, this year she has collaborated with various commercial sidelines within spitting distance of the High Line, New York, where she is director. Alemani’s commissions at the latter include work by Pamela Rosenkranz, Yu Ji and Gabriel Chaile, among others. At Gagosian, just a block from the linear sculpture park’s entrance, Alemani curated a Tetsuya Ishida retrospective, featuring more than 80 of the late Japanese artist’s nightmarishly surreal paintings. And a mere two blocks further on, at the old Dia Chelsea premises, Alemani staged an exhibition of work by 70 women artists owned by collectors Komal Shah and Gaurav Garg (which will travel to California’s Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive and the Kemper Art Museum in St Louis). Whether the carbon-footprint-conscious Alemani left Chelsea to sit on the jury of Canada’s Sobey prize [https://artreview.com/kablusiak-wins-2023-sobey-art-award/] is unknown.",

            "This year was a fraught time to lead a German cultural institution, as Israeli bombing of Palestine converged with the long shadow of German twentieth-century history. During his leadership at Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, which commenced in January 2023, Ndikung has had to accommodate the institution’s commitment to artists of the Global South, where support for Palestine is high, while being alert to the pro-Israel stance of much of the local audience and media. In November last year, pro-Palestine protesters hung a banner at the entrance to the institution, and in April they interrupted a conference titled ‘Remembering Colonialism’. In the exhibition halls, the Euro 2024 football tournament provided a structure for the museum to reflect on migration, gender and racism in sport. The announcement then that Ndikung will curate the 2025 Bienal de São Paulo [https://artreview.com/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung-to-curate-the-36th-bienal-de-sao-paulo/] under the title Not All Travellers Walk Roads – Of Humanity as Practice offered a welcome relief, with a series of precursor research conferences already underway in Morocco and Guadeloupe.",

            "In January the American filmmaker was ruminating on being a Black artist adored by museums. ‘We could come in there saying, “We just want to be one of the guys, we just want to be a part of the canon,” but they know we don’t know how to do anything but break shit. We come to fuck shit up.’ That fucking up of shit takes the form of mesmerising films concerning Blackness, death and history. At LUMA Westbau, in Zurich, he remixed his 2013 work APEX, slowing down the original eight-minute video collage to 33 minutes and adding accompanying beats by Detroit techno pioneer Robert Hood. A newfound interest in abstraction was present in LOML (2022), which paid homage to the late writer and musician Greg Tate, shown at the Gwangju Biennale. Meanwhile Melbourne audiences got the greatest hits, including Love is the Message, The Message is Death [https://artreview.com/work-of-the-week-arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message/] (2016), at the Fiona and Sidney Myer Gallery, and last year’s survey [https://artreview.com/a-guide-to-arts-and-culture-this-november/] at OGR Torino closed in February. Meanwhile a collaboration with Supreme became mired in controversy when the fashion brand’s creative director departed, citing the company’s ‘systemic racism’.",

They write, ‘political morality takes time, a patient and courageous way of learning and naming’, a slowness lost in the media churn of outrage and easy condemnation. Considerations such as these come naturally to the Gender Trouble (1990) author and comparative literature professor at UC Berkeley, who remains a champion of queer and gender theory, and who published The Livable and the Unlivable this year (coauthored with Frédéric Worms), a treatise on intersectional care in the face of identity-based and ecological violence. It was these subjects and more that they picked up with a series of speakers – among them philosophers Paul B. Preciado, Elsa Dorlin, Hourya Bentouhami and psychoanalyst Monique David-Ménard – in the first of their events organised as part of being the 2023–24 intellectual-in-residence at the Pompidou in Paris.",

Titled You and I Don’t Live on the Same Planet, the exhibition examines how political polarisation and the climate emergency intersect through a series of ‘planets’ inhabited by artists including Yao Jui-Chung, Cooking Sections and Pierre Huyghe. Meanwhile there were further shows and conferences (Critical Zones and ‘Driving the Human’ at the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe), viral essays (‘we have actually proven that it is possible, in a few weeks, to put an economic system on hold everywhere in the world’, he wrote for AOC, translated into at least 12 languages) and artist talks (with\nSarah Sze at the Fondation Cartier in Paris).\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

The show featured 67 artists attempting to make sense of these confusing times, more than half showing in Japan for the first time. And Raqs remains pioneering in the way that it has apparently seamlessly folded academic research and curating largescale exhibitions (which include iterations of Manifesta and the Shanghai Biennale) into its practice, grounded in a form of ‘kinetic contemplation’ that accepts and exploits the potential of disorientation within the passage of space and time. That made Raqs well placed to produce a new videowork, 31 days, online as part of HKW’s CC: World project examining the shape and form of conversation in the midst of lockdowns and a pandemic.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

A Woman You Thought You Knew, which brought together works from the Kadist collection, was staged at the nonprofit’s gallery in San Francisco, while its Paris gallery boasted a programme that featured an evening of performances inspired by medieval French poetry, Manthia Diawara and Hoor Al Qasimi [https://artreview.com/artist/sheikha-hoor-al-qasimi/] in conversation, and a group show of Ukrainian artists in collaboration with the Palais de Tokyo. Partech Africa is the largest fund dedicated to African startups, and Kadist has been increasingly present on the continent. It supported the annual exhibition Dig Where You Stand, which this year took place in two cities in Benin (Cotonou and Ouidah), and in November staged a festival at Fondation H in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.",

Mousse magazine even cited her when announcing its redesign this year. Though it has been a quiet year for publishing, with limited public speaking beyond her professor emerita role at the History of Consciousness department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, it’s understandable why she remains such a touchstone: her writing addresses so many of our current issues, from the environment, to gender and queer identity, to AI and tech. Haraway’s thinking is nothing if not intersectional: regarding her papal citation, coming despite her long history of criticising the Catholic Church, she quipped, ‘Some baby Jesuit who’s into animal studies and science studies and feminist theory for some weird reason has been reading me’. They’re not alone.",

Lee’s approach, which has focused on organising prominent international exhibitions, including collateral shows at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], made their name – as well as her own. Now that Seoul has become a major node in the art market, Lee, whose gallery was founded in 1982 and represents approximately 50 artists, including Haegue Yang and the newly signed eighty-nine-year-old sculptor Kim Yun Shin (featured in this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/]), is more ambivalent about how helpful artworld hype can be. ‘I think we should not be “too excited” about the Korean art scene being globally recognized, becoming another art hub in Asia… Both galleries and artists should stay on their toes,’ she warned The Korea Herald. Now a family affair, with Lee’s children involved, Kukje is no doubt in it for the long haul.",

            "On the face of it, this year marked a time of radical change for Cheng, who resigned as CEO of New World Development Co, the company set up by his grandfather. He remained in charge, however, of the K11 Art Foundation, which holds exhibitions in its various branded venues (tied to New World’s property portfolio) and arranges discussion forums – labelled ‘Salons’, this year in Seoul, London and Saudi Arabia – as well as artist residences. Also in 2024: the inaugural K11 Artist Prize, designed to support emerging Asian artists and spearheaded by the foundation’s International Council, featuring prominent collectors Sarah Arison and Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo [https://artreview.com/artist/patrizia-sandretto-re-rebaudengo/], and cultural strategist Alia Al-Senussi among its members. Cheng said his resignation permits him more time for public service, which includes chairing the Hong Kong government’s Mega Arts and Cultural Events Committee, responsible for providing incentives to major international events (such as Art Basel’s HK edition), and the various museum boards he attends, including New York’s MoMA PS1 and the Met, Paris’s Centre Pompidou and London’s Tate and Royal Academy of Arts.",

With its rakish reputation, the gallery was always going to be at home in the Marais in Paris, where it opened a fourth official space in October with a group show that typically mixed Brazilian and international names. ‘Official’ because the restless trio don’t tend to contain themselves solely to their addresses in São Paulo (a warehouse mothership), Brussels (opened in 2017) and their New York TriBeCa gallery. They spent their summer staging a group show at a seventeenth-century church in the bucolic Dutch coastal village of Retranchement, with a large group show of works on paper by artists including Michael Dean and Mariana Castillo Deball; while a show by painter Marina Perez Simão was the fourth to be staged at Villa Era, a nineteenth-century estate in the Italian countryside. Now they’ve refurbished a property in Upstate New York for residencies, starting with Paulo Nazareth and Paulo Monteiro.",

At least in part, the growing mightiness of the African artworld is down to the curator’s own efforts. As the director of Cape Town’s Zeitz MOCAA since 2019, and having established her name through the RAW Material Company in Senegal, Kouoh has become a leading light at home and abroad. Current shows at the institution include solos for Ghanaian-American artist Rita Mawuena Benissan [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-november-2024/#:~:text=Rita%20Mawuena%20Benissan] and South African Nolan Oswald Dennis. Earlier this year, Kunstmuseum Basel opened When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting [https://artreview.com/a-century-of-black-figuration-in-painting-review/], a survey exhibition curated by Kouoh that debuted at Zeitz. Not that it has all been plain sailing: in June, the artist Tracey Rose lambasted Kouoh and Kunstmuseum Bern, claiming that a work about Palestine had been censored [https://artreview.com/kunstmuseum-bern-hosting-tracey-rose-retrospective-branded-despicable-by-artist/] in her solo show at the Swiss institution, curated by Kouoh. Earlier this year, Kouoh oversaw Zeitz MOCAA’s annual gala, the proceeds of which help fund its educational and curatorial programming.",

            "Lisson Gallery, founded by Nicholas in 1967, with son Alex and Hilty now acting as trusted directors, might be long in the tooth but has proved remarkably agile in the face of 2020’s challenges. The gallery, one of the founding members of the Gallery Climate Coalition (a nonprofit launched in October with the aim of developing an industry-wide response to the climate crisis) has long been making sales ‘based purely on images’, Logsdail junior told Forbes, and as such the disruption wasn’t going to faze them: an online screening and exhibition programme launched in May. They did however open a galley in the Hamptons, where many monied New Yokers chose to sit out lockdown, and quickly set a sales record for Stanley Whitney, selling a painting for $850,000. Likewise, with the physical Frieze art fair in London cancelled, Lisson opened a new temporary space in Mayfair (leased until March). While London and New York City went in and out of lockdowns, the gallery’s one-year-old Shanghai premises staged shows for Shirazeh Houshiary and Julian Opie, with the latter launching multiple public art projects in the city.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Other blockbusters included Maurizio Cattelan: The Last Judgement (the artist’s first solo exhibition in China), on view at UCCA Beijing this winter, while over at coastal outpost Dune, Daniel Arsham’s fictional ruins engaged with the site’s geological features. Amidst all this, Tinari found time to curate the inaugural Ad-Diriyah Biennale in Saudi Arabia, which opened in December, while planning towards the opening of a fourth space, in Chengdu, for 2024, as part of the city’s International Art Island development (for which he’s an adviser). Perhaps UCCA curator-at-large Peter Eleey, who Tinari swiped from MoMA PS1 earlier this year, will be able to help with the load.",

Continua’s Beijing space opened in 2005. This year, while most dealers were chasing collectors to ex-urban resorts of the rich, Continua took a punt on central Paris (as well as a popup for Anish Kapoor in Dubai). ‘There was sadness’ to the shuttered city, Fiaschi told The Art Newspaper. They opened, he added ‘to generate smiles’, first with a JR-curated exhibition pre-refurb, followed by two group shows. Still undergoing renovation is the controversially privatised Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo, where the gallery staged a small show of Cuban artists in anticipation of opening a space within the complex. Also conflicted is the trio’s operation in Cuba, which some Cuban activists have accused of legitimising the government.",

Its four spaces in Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore were closed for months due to public health restrictions. Headquartered in Shanghai, the gallery came out of hibernation ready to dominate the city’s art scene during the last quarter of 2020, with its A-listers getting an impressive airing. Xue Song showed at Powerlong Museum, Yang Zhenzhong at Rén Space, Zhang Enli at Power Station of Art, Zhu Jia at Modern Art Base and Yang Fudong at HOW Art Museum – all in the same month! But Shanghart is not all about the Chinese-Male-Artist-of-a-Certain-Age. At its own M50 space is Under the Sign of Saturn, a group show featuring three young female artists from Guangzhou – Qin Jin, Chen Dandizi and Lin Yuqi – demonstrating its commitment to supporting new voices from outside the typical centres of art production.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

As the former member of the Italian Communist Party told Vogue this year, family takes up another third, while the rest of her time is devoted to ‘culture and the Fondazione’. The Venice-and-Milan-based private institution is no trinket (with Tokyo and Shanghai project spaces), and Prada is very hands-on, telling Vogue how she struggled to find a curator who would fully embrace her vision of a future show on feminism. She did, however, get the likes of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler to curate Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Technology and Power, 1500–2025, a Marx-tinged show on tech and power that closed in January; while Meriem Bennani installed a solo exhibition in Milan, Christoph Büchel [https://artreview.com/christoph-buchel-monte-di-pieta-fondazione-prada-venice-biennale/] in Venice, Michaël Borremans in China and Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin in Japan.",

This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration – something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

The patron, whose Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo has amassed a collection of more than 1,500 artworks, has long had exhibition spaces in Turin and neighbouring Guarene, but in recent years she’s been expanding her reach: she’s turning a Venetian island into an art centre (set to open next year), and the Madrid wing of the Fondazione is now homing in on a permanent HQ. Sandretto also sits on committees at New York’s MoMA, New Museum and CCS Bard, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, London’s Tate Modern, Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum and Barcelona’s Fundación MACBA, among others. At her eponymous Turin foundation meanwhile, she gave solo shows to The Otolith Group, Stefanie Heinze and Bekhbaatar Enkhtur.",

Three months later, a partnership deal was announced between NGS, where 70 percent of the collection is dedicated to Singaporean artists and 30 percent to Southeast Asian artists, and the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts to encourage loans, research partnerships and residency programmes. The 2024 exhibitions programme at NGS featured a retrospective of Kim Lim and shows for Cheong Soo Pieng, pioneer of the Nanyang art style, and centenarian Lim Tze Peng, Singapore’s oldest living and active artist. Meanwhile, Pratchaya Phinthong and Yee I-Lann received shows at SAM which also supported the organisation of Robert Zhao Renhui’s Singaporean Pavilion [https://artreview.com/robert-zhao-renhui-on-representing-singapore-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] (NGS also made a substantial loan of eight works to the Biennale’s International Pavilion [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/], curated by Adriano Pedrosa [https://artreview.com/artist/adriano-pedrosa/?year=2024]).",

            "‘There were some difficult times after the biennale was pushed back,’ said Kim, the president of the Gwangju Biennale Foundation. Postponing the exhibition, curated by Defne Ayas and Natasha Ginwala, to February 2021 means organisers will miss the 40-year anniversary of the Gwangju Uprising, the brutally suppressed democracy protests the event memorialises. Symbolism is important for Kim, evident not least in her Real DMZ project, which has seen art placed within the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea and its border area since 2012. A work by Soyoung Chung, presented in collaboration with the Real DMZ’s Negotiating Borders 2, had an afterlife at the Curitiba Biennial, which closed in February. Kim got a show by Belgian artist Francis Alÿs up and running at Tai Kwun Contemporary, Hong Kong, and took the reins (with SooJin Lee) of a huge Lee Bul retrospective, Utopia Saved, at St Petersburg’s Manege Central Exhibition Hall.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

While HKW was closed at the start of the year, they continued much of their programme, such as the ongoing thread The New Alphabet, exploring alternative forms of learning, online. From the summer, the two-year project Investigative Commons was launched, following on a long collaboration with Forensic Architecture, exploring how we might re-establish notions of public truth, while the exhibition and publication Illiberal Arts addressed the inequities at the heart of liberal capitalism. The multistrand, fast-paced programme has continued with the oral history project Archive of Refuge, turning to the memories of people who migrated to Germany over the past 70 years, and working towards the conference series The White West: Whose Universal? next year. Alongside the institution’s director Bernd Scherer, Franke continues to push at the idea of what a contemporary institution can be.",

It is not just the high profile at home that marks out the gallery, but the global network that its geographically-diverse artist roster has firmly infiltrated.

Kurimanzutto’s satellite space in New York gives them clout there, too: this year, the Met installed specially commissioned architectural interventions by Nairy Baghramian and Petrit Halilaj, and in February the gallery announced the representation of the estate of the late New York icon John Giorno.",

            "‘There is no discussion of art anymore,’ concluded Steyerl at the close of 2023 when contemplating the artworld in Germany. ‘It’s Israel–Palestine, and that’s it,’ she told The New York Times. The artist had removed her work from Documenta in 2022 [https://artreview.com/hito-steyerl-says-she-has-no-faith-in-documenta-tackling-antisemitism/] due to what she perceived as inaction by its curators over antisemitism, and was scathing of many of her peers who had publicly criticised Israel, telling The Guardian that many were merely practising ‘art as social media performance’. Furthermore, she bemoaned that it was those who only condemn violence on one side ‘that dominate the debate’. Steyerl’s engagement with the conflict comes as no surprise: questions of power, violence and mediation have been her subject matter for two decades now, parlayed into her video essays and multimedia installations. This year she premiered three new works that take the Nord Stream oil pipeline system as their subject at the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, and settled into her new role as professor in Emergent Digital Media at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

            "Artist, curator, institutional director – Al Qasimi can claim to belong to nearly every constituent sector of the artworld (albeit these days she’s not really that well known for her painting). Plus, in the real world, she’s royalty. And yet, in recent years she has leveraged her expertise and knowledge of art from the Gulf region and further afield, to operate in geographies beyond the Emirate and areas in which she can absolutely rely on royal privilege. An exhibition of paintings she curated by the senior Māori artist Emily Karaka, which opened this autumn at the Sharjah Art Foundation, of which she is also president and founding director, may be indicative of the direction planned for the 2026 Biennale of Sydney [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-lead-the-2026-biennale-of-sydney/]. Al Qasimi was this year appointed curator of the Australian survey, which she will work on while developing her plans for the 2025 Aichi Triennale [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-direct-aichi-triennale-2025/] in Japan, of which she is artistic director (the first non-Japanese person to occupy the position, although she speaks the language, having studied there). Having previously curated the Lahore Biennale (in 2020) and the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Al Qasimi is in demand, and her global presence is reflected in her home institution’s programming, which, in addition to Karaka, has featured survey exhibitions of South African multimedia icon William Kentridge, Brazilian painter Antonio Dias and Pakistani artist and Women’s Action Forum cofounder Lala Rukh, not to mention the annual March Meeting [https://artreview.com/the-top-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-march-2024/#:~:text=March%20Meeting%202024%3A%20Tawashujat] conference. Next February marks the opening of the 16th Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/] (Al Qasimi curated the 2023 edition [https://artreview.com/artists-for-2023-sharjah-biennial-revealed/], developing a programme initiated by the late Okwui Enwezor, having been involved with the event – as director – since 2003, when she cocurated the sixth edition). For this edition, Al Qasimi has appointed an all-female team of curators [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] that includes many of the leading lights among curators operating in the context of the global majority, including Sri Lanka’s Natasha Ginwala [https://artreview.com/artist/natasha-ginwala/], Indonesian curator Alia Swastika [https://artreview.com/artist/alia-swastika/?year=2024], Bahraini-Singaporean artist Amal Khalaf, New Zealand artist Megan Tamati-Quennell and Turkish curator Zeynep Öz. Moreover, in the context of an artworld in which cancellations and boycotts are rife – coming from every direction – and generating a consequent culture of fear, Al Qasimi remains one of the few voices still prepared to use the platform art (and royal privilege) affords them in order to express their opinions directly and to keep discussions that most people allow to fade away firmly in the spotlight, whether they concern the current carnage in Palestine and Lebanon or those suffering from other conflicts across the globe. Beyond all that, Al Qasimi also serves as president of the International Biennale Association, president of the hugely influential Africa Institute in Sharjah and on the board of Ashkal Alwan in Beirut. She is also on the advisory boards of the Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi and Darat al Funun in Amman. Beyond her involvement with art, she also founded the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, and earlier this year presented a clothing collection in London which was developed from the work of her late brother, who worked in the fashion industry. But beyond her personal achievements, Al Qasimi is also a symbol of the increasing influence of the Gulf region in the spheres of finance, commerce, politics, sports and entertainment, and, of course (but perhaps primarily by virtue of the first two elements on this list) art.",

Organised chronologically and installed, as always, by the artist and his team (over 16 days and nights, he says), it provided an easy image of the photographer’s journey from nightclub imagery to a more wide-ranging experimentation in representing the world around him (and beyond: astronomy is a passion). Meanwhile, Fragile, a show touring African cities over the past five years, arrived at its final stop across two venues in Lagos; his solo at Mumok, Vienna, closed after an extended run in August. And then Tillmans was back in London for a round of fundraising on behalf of the ICA, where he has been chair since 2019. Demonstrating that his penchant for hedonism isn’t over, Tillmans outlined plans to make the art institution party central, including a licence to serve alcohol until 6am.",

            "Following on from several years of more hard-hitting, London-focused film projects – including the 2020 Small Axe series of five films that charted the lives of West Indian immigrants to the city, codirecting the documentary Uprising (2021) on a 1981 fire in South London, and his filmic monument Grenfell [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-will-not-look-away-serpentine-gallery-london/] (2023), a single-shot circling of the site of the tragic 2017 apartment block fire – the gap between McQueen’s art and cinema projects feels wider of late. This year, McQueen received a solo exhibition that continues to occupy both Dia sites in New York, with several film works and a new photographic series on display in the institution’s Chelsea space, and in a massive former factory site Beacon is his new installation Bass, the basement space filled only with coloured lighting and reverberating with snatches of music (The music an extended jam session, recorded in-situ, between different forms of the titular instrument, played by a stellar ensemble that included Meshell Ndegeochello and jazz veteran Marcus Miller.) The show received widespread acclaim, and will travel to Switzerland’s Schaulager next year. He also released the documentary Occupied City [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-review/], in which he slowly traced and filmed all the locations that appear in author, historian and producer (and McQueen’s wife) Bianca Stigter’s book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940–1945 (2019). Offering a meditative study of the Dutch capital under the Nazis, it was a cinematic tour de force that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.\n\nSo far, so auteur. McQueen’s second celluloid outing this year, Blitz, however, which opened to mixed reviews, demonstrated how mainstream he can go. Telling the story of a young boy during the World War II bombing of London, it was ‘an old-fashioned children’s adventure movie, a rollicking yarn that might have been on television on a Bank Holiday afternoon’, thought the BBC. ‘Shockingly conventional’, Variety noted. But McQueen seems confident straddling both documentary and fiction forms, as well as arthouse and (attempted) blockbuster modes, and continues to serve as a model to artists who might want to make work that can occupy the gallery, the cinema, as well as home streaming platforms.",

This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

            "‘An institution is a learning system’, Obrist told Forbes this year while discussing the ‘Year of AI’ at London’s Serpentine Galleries. Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
