            "‘Alone.’ This is how Denes says she felt as a pioneer of ecological art. In 1982 she created Wheatfield – A Confrontation, nearly an entire hectare of wheat planted and harvested on a plot of land in the shadow of New York’s Twin Towers: a work of Land art protesting capitalist greed and the degradation of the planet. The gesture was repeated this year both in a plot of land neighbouring Tinworks Art in Bozeman, Montana, and on moveable pallets outside Art Basel, the confrontation of the art market and Denes’s protest deliciously uncomfortable. What the interest in these new iterations did demonstrate was how much, amid a worsening climate emergency, the artworld and its own increasing attention to the study of land, ecofeminism and the relationship between humanity and the environment, has caught up with Denes’s way of thinking. This year she had institutional shows at the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest (the city in which she was born), and Lunds Konsthall, in Sweden (where she grew up), and participated in nine major group shows. Denes, at ninety-three, refuses to slow down – her next project: how to create ‘vertical fields’.",

            "With some persistent jitters around the health of the art market, Art Basel CEO Horowitz admitted a ‘period of recalibration’ was now in place. Dealers told Ocula that sales at Art Basel Hong Kong were just ‘okay’, while visitor numbers were ‘thin’, and exhibitors also had to negotiate the new censorious national security law introduced by the territory’s legislators (Art Basel has signed a new three-year partnership with Hong Kong’s tourist board; the fair also has a partnership with Art Week Tokyo, possibly indicating a hedging of their Asian presence). At the Swiss edition of the fair, however, there was a ‘sigh of relief’ after day one. This art fair model remains a gallery’s safest route to sales: 195 dealers, an increase of 27 percent from last year, signed up to take part in Art Basel Paris, now established in the newly renovated Grand Palais. Offsetting the growing nervousness, the Miami edition has offered smaller, cheaper booths for the first time, to increase the fair’s accessibility for participating galleries.",

Of late she has carved out a niche shepherding the installation of largescale public works across the Gulf. In January, in her role as director of the Abu Dhabi Culture Programming and Cultural Foundation, she cocurated the inaugural Manar Abu Dhabi, 35 site-specific works spread along a 2.3km route, including light projections, sculptures, installations and performances by the likes of Carsten Höller [https://artreview.com/the-interview-carsten-holler-adam-haar-dance-with-daemons-fondation-beyeler-riehen-basel-jj-charlesworth/], Mohammed Kazem, Shilpa Gupta and Team Lab. November, meanwhile, marked the opening of the first edition of the Public Art Abu Dhabi Biennial, which Fadda also directs: the curator invited some 70 artists from the region and abroad – Farah Al Qasimi [https://artreview.com/ghosts-make-me-feel-more-comfortable-artist-farah-al-qasimi-seeks-out-the-supernatural/], Radhika Khimji and Sammy Baloji [https://artreview.com/artist/sammy-baloji/] among them – to create site-specific installations and performances, bringing contemporary art to the streets of Abu Dhabi and Al Ain.",

From the 2022 installation Unsupervised at New York’s MoMA and his takeover of the digital skin of Las Vegas’s Sphere in 2023, Anadol’s studio has powered through 2024 with projects emphasising the artist’s interest in organic networks: solo shows at Kunsthal Rotterdam and London’s Serpentine Galleries offered visualisations generated from data on coral reef and rainforest flora and fauna, part of Anadol’s bigger ‘Large Nature Model’ initiative. Bringing together multiple environmental datasets, the model experiments with the possibility that AI might be trained to find insights in ecological rather than human-produced information, with iterations appearing at Google’s annual conference and the United Nations. And with artist and studio cofounder Efsun Erkılıç, Anadol has recently announced Dataland, a permanent museum and centre for AI arts, set to open in LA next year.",

His touring exhibition [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/] from 2022 continued this year at the Frist Art Museum in Nashville, and he had work in 21 group shows across the US, and in the UK and Canada.

Screenings continued this year for AI: African Intelligence (2022), which hitches life and ritual in African fishing villages to the emergence of artificial intelligence, and ponders an Africanised relationship to algorithms; as well as Angela Davis: A World of Greater Freedom (2023), which articulates the activist’s ideas on freedom, resistance, prison abolition and more. The Malian polymath put on another hat this year as a cocurator of Bamako Encounters [https://artreview.com/the-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-december-2024/#:~:text=14th%20Bamako%20Encounters%3A%20Kuma%2C%20the%20Word], Africa’s most prominent biennial dedicated to photography. The 14th edition opened in November under the title Kuma (Bambara for ‘the word’), and features artists from across the continent whose work explores the interplay of image and language – a relation that Diawara has been mining for over three decades.",

            "It feels like the artworld is only now catching up to Shonibare’s art, a longstanding prism for what have become our era’s central concerns. In his Serpentine solo this year, the British-Nigerian artist’s signature figures wrapped in colourful faux-African Dutch batik took the form of imperial statues, radiating colonial pasts and asking to be toppled. Simultaneously in London he appeared in museum group exhibitions related to textiles and British colonial history. In the Venice Biennale’s international show [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/] his hunched, possessions-carrying refugee astronaut [https://artreview.com/60th-venice-biennale-review-who-can-judge-foreigners-everywhere-adriano-pedrosa/#:~:text=anything%20about%20it%3F-,Foreigners%20Everywhere,-%2C%2060th%20Venice%20Biennale] embodied incoming climate displacement, while in the Nigerian Pavilion [https://artreview.com/aindrea-emelife-on-curating-the-nigerian-pavilion-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] he addressed restitution via clay statues harkening back to objects looted from Benin by British colonists. In Nigeria Shonibare also inaugurated his first public sculpture in Lagos, where the artist spent a part of his childhood. Meanwhile, he continued to pay it forward via his five-year-old nonprofit GAS residency programme in Lagos and Ijebu (which welcomed over 20 new residents this year), facilitating exchange between diverse practitioners in order, it appears, to alter the fabric of culture itself.",

Her works are often platforms for performances by poets, musicians and dancers, the monumental structures enabling a wider network of collaborators and ideas. Alongside a solo show at Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum in St. Louis, Dyson presented Birds and Lava (Scott Joplin), a pavilionlike public sculpture throughout which the music of titular ragtime pianist played.",

Its continued engagement with the writing of regional art histories has further cemented the status of the Hong Kong-based nonprofit as the leading resource for Asian art scholars. AAA launched new collections on independent art spaces in Taiwan, as well as the Siu King Chung Archive, which features materials about Hong Kong art and the development of self-organised art practices in particular, from the 1980s to the 2000s. It also opened two research-intensive exhibitions. Another Day in Hong Kong included interviews with over a hundred individuals from Hong Kong’s art community about their recollections of 19 October 1996 (this was identified as being the median day out of all the dates in AAA’s HK-based records). Countering Time, which opened in September, presents new works by Merve Ünsal, Simon Leung, Gala Porras-Kim and Lee Weng Choy, who speculate on the immeasurability of time.\n\n*(24 in 2022, with John Tain; 12 in 2021, with Tain and Claire Hsu [https://artreview.com/artist/christopher-k-ho-claire-hsu-john-tain/])",

Cultural workers can reinforce essentialist ideas around this, or they can choose to challenge majoritarian views,’ wrote the artist in the introduction of Midnight’s Third Child [https://artreview.com/midnights-third-child-by-naeem-mohaiemen-review-trying-harder/] (2023), a new anthology of his essays. As art scenes from the Global South assert their presence, Mohaiemen’s writing and his essayistic films on leftwing struggles in the region offer a blueprint to imagining a new structure beyond the established neoliberal norm. His work screens internationally, with fans in activist-academic circles as much as gallerygoers. Most notably Jole Dobe Na (Those Who Do Not Drown) (2020) was a key moment of the Gwangju Biennale this year, while the newer, more personal feature film Grace (2022) premiered at his solo at Colby College Museum of Art, in Maine, which closed in April; the Documenta 14-commissioned (and Turner Prize-nominated) Two Meetings and a Funeral film (2017) was shown at Kölnischer Kunstverein. ‘The people, projects, and conversations in this anthology frequently take on a role of speaking back to power,’ he wrote. The same can be said of the rest of his oeuvre.",

            "The globalist outlook that has marked Mohebbi’s stewardship of New York’s Sculpture Center showed no sign of abating this year; nor did the Iranian-born curator appear obliged only to showcase ‘sculpture’. Early in the year, Mohebbi brought the moving-image strand of 2023’s Taipei Biennial [https://artreview.com/taipei-biennial-2023-small-world-review-taipei-fine-arts-museum/] to the US, featuring works by Li Yi-Fan [https://artreview.com/li-yi-fan-wins-the-golden-harvest-award/], Jen Liu [https://artreview.com/jen-liu-i-am-cloud-blindspot-gallery-hong-kong-review-aaina-bhargava/] and Jumana Manna, among others (and in a neat extramural East–West flip, he curated the film programme of Art Week Tokyo in November). Meanwhile, the institution spotlighted all kinds of simultaneously forward-thinking and slantwise practice: from Bastien Gachet’s complex self-described ‘dramaturgy’ of faked and fabricated objects to Phoebe Collings-James’s abject ceramics. This summer saw artist and choreographer Alexa West use the art centre as a stage for constantly unfolding rehearsals, exploring the intersection of dance and sculpture. In a recent piece collecting ‘notes to self’ for Mousse, Mohebbi invoked the Caribbean notion of ‘mawonaj’, meaning to be pointedly difficult to pin down. At Sculpture Center, he’s walking the talk.",

The Los Angeles-based artist uses her unconventional tools (as well as sculpture, painting, video and templelike presentation formats) to reveal clandestine connections across space and time, and to address, as she’s put it, ‘notions of cultural, gendered and racial difference, rampant sexualities and deviant behaviour’; all of which results in a practice that appropriates and upends modes of presentation often found in natural history exhibitions. Pigs and Poison (2020) interlinked the history of biological warfare, the Opium Wars, indentured Chinese slavery in the US and anti-Asian sentiment in the wake of COVID-19; this year’s installation Lithium Sex Demons in the Factory [https://artreview.com/candice-lin-infected-mythologies-gam-milan/] folded ghost stories and reports of Asian women experiencing demonic possession in electronics factories into a sprawling, object- and video-driven narrative in which horny spirits haunt a lithium battery factory. Lin’s work is a timely guide for how ambitious and unpredictable contemporary art can be.",

The postponement provided some unexpected respite from a very busy year. In October Fonseca opened Fullgás at CCBB Rio de Janeiro, a survey of visual art in Brazil during the 1980s featuring approximately 300 works by over 200 artists. Fonseca was also touring Frieze London in October, as part of a purchasing committee for Tate, while acting as a curatorial adviser to the Prospect 6 triennial in New Orleans, which opened in November. Fonseca is now gearing up for Counterpublic in 2026, the citywide exhibition in St Louis that has appointed him as part of a five-strong curatorial committee. Fonseca has a day job, too. As curator of modern and contemporary Latin American art at Denver Art Museum, he opened an exhibition in April of Chilean artist Sandra Vásquez de la Horra’s fantasy-inflected paintings and drawings.",

The breakthrough was Open City, the 2011 novel that made his name, and ‘a bellwether of the last decade’s autofictional turn’, as The New Yorker wrote recently. With publication of Tremor, the overlaps between plot and art are even more acute: Tunde, a Nigerian photographer teaching at an Ivy League university, tries to photograph a street at night, but is interrupted by a suspicious (white) homeowner and shooed away. The resulting intricate meditation on the act of looking, concentrating, who gets to see what and from what perspective (with a cameo for Otobong Nkanga’s soap-production project) is why artists increasingly turn to his work for insight. When Tunde speaks, we can imagine Cole’s own thoughts. Cole teaches in the Harvard English department, as well writing for The New York Times (where he produced a photography column until 2019).",

Weaponry is a fitting motif for the artist: he has been uncompromising in his fight against the misappropriation of Indigenous visual culture and the collective amnesia towards the colonial crimes of the past. Such anger was unflinchingly disclosed in the red neon text work Galanin made for his exhibition, Interference Patterns, at SITE Santa Fe in January, which read, over a grid of doormats, ‘I’ve Composed a New National Anthem: Take a Knee and Scream Until You Can’t Breathe’. The howl is being heard. Galanin was also included in a dozen group shows this year, including the Public Art Abu Dhabi Biennial and the Toronto Biennial, and in April he received a Guggenheim Fellowship.",

            "Can an art exhibition take in a wetland walk? Or a conversation with a forest god? That’s the kind of expansionist vision Ginwala brings to curating. ‘Dense, multi-sensory, and rhizomatic, it speaks through entanglements and intersections’ – this was e-flux Criticism’s assessment of Colomboscope, the festival Ginwala has directed in Sri Lanka since 2019. With curators Sheelasha Rajbhandari, Hit Man Gurung and Sarker Protick, this year’s iteration took nature, ecofeminism and Indigeneity as its themes and soon spread beyond the gallery. It is, Ginwala said, a ‘perspective that rises beyond the geopolitical fragmentations that our part of the world faces’. Such an approach will likely be detected in the section she is curating at the Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] in February (she is one of a five-strong team of curators). Ginwala has said ‘the ancient stepwells in Indian Ocean littoral sites and water wells found in Sharjah’s historic households and courtyards’ will serve as her personal leitmotifs [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/], ones ‘that avow ancestral memory, place-making, sonic remembrance and cross-generational convening amidst tides of annihilation’.",

Moulton is currently deputy chair of Shepparton Art Museum and is a board member for the First Nations nonprofit Adam Briggs Foundation. As senior curator and artistic associate for Melbourne’s Rising festival, she curated Shadow Spirit, an exhibition of immersive commissions by First Nation artists installed in an abandoned train station in June, which will tour to Adelaide; this summer, Moulton also cocurated More Than a Tarrang (tree): Memory, Material and Cultural Agency at Melbourne Museum. She has spoken of the ‘overwhelming sadness’ she feels seeing looted or sacred indigenous objects in colonial museums. Now the British institutional world will hear her voice louder: she has recently been appointed Tate Modern’s adjunct curator in First Nations and Indigenous Art.",

She was the first Indigenous curator at the Museu de Arte de São Paulo, but quit last year [https://artreview.com/brazils-first-institutional-indigenous-curator-quits-over-censorship-row-sandra-benites/] after a series of photographs representing leftwing workers and Indigenous rights movements were cut from a show (the museum denied censorship, saying the works were delivered too late). In April she cocurated the first Bienal das Amazônias in Belém, exposing ‘the reality of the Amazons, especially around the idea of fetish the Amazon represents’. As that opened, and with Nhé ẽ Se, an exhibition cocurated with artist Sallisa Rosa at Caixa Cultural Brasilia already in the works, she became the new director of visual arts at Funarte, a government-aligned foundation, giving her immense influence over the country’s visual arts budget and policy, and marking her out as a model for Indigenous curating internationally.",

Spora, her ongoing ‘environmental institutional critique’ programming, was augmented with an intervention by Pulitzer Prize-winning artist Raven Chacon, while the ambitious group show Energies, staged across the Swiss Institute’s three storeys as well as in other community locations throughout the East Village, garnered critical acclaim – a reviewer calling it ‘one of the boldest curatorial feats… in recent memory’. Tapping into the local history of a sweat-equity co-op (which powered through the 1973 oil crisis with its own wind turbine and went on to win a legal battle against energy giant Con Edison), the show mixed archival material with intergenerational artistic perspectives on the universal and urgent topic of energy to demonstrate the power of cooperation and community organisation in the face of environmental collapse. Meanwhile, across the pond, Hessler curated Art Basel’s outdoor Parcours section this past summer, including work by Rirkrit Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/artist/rirkrit-tiravanija/] and Joanna Piotrowska [https://artreview.com/joanna-piotrowska-unseeing-eyes-restless-bodies-institute-of-contemporary-art-philadelphia-review-chris-murtha/].",

Frieze, under CEO Fox, is adept at making an art fair feel like an event, and this year added to its US footprint not only by moving the West Coast edition to Santa Monica Airport but by hosting the recently acquired Expo Chicago and the Armory Show in New York. ‘The economics of art fairs are challenging,’ Fox told the same reporter in March. Referring to Emanuel’s Endeavor, Frieze’s parent company, he added, ‘We are taken very seriously by Ari and the team’. A month is a long time in business. A few weeks later plans were put in place to take Endeavor private in 2025 (after equity fund Silver Lake bought the $13b of stock it didn’t already own), and the group is now considering selling the art fair in a pessimistic market: just ‘moderate sales’ were reported at the third edition of Frieze Seoul, though the London original was deemed more successful, helped by the sale of a number of works to several UK institutional collections (aided by Endeavor-funded partnerships with the fair) including the Contemporary Art Society, Tate and the Arts Council.",

            "Julien’s 2022 five-screen film installation Once Again… (Statues Never Die) explores the relationship between Albert C. Barnes, an early collector of African art, and Alain Locke, the Harlem Renaissance instigator and proponent of restitution, with all the sensuality that has become characteristic of the British artist’s work. The film was exhibited this year at the Whitney Biennial [https://artreview.com/whitney-biennial-2024-new-york-review/], New York, and MCA Australia, Sydney, where The Sydney Morning Herald, ‘in an age where so-called political and postcolonial art tends toward sermonising’, found the film ‘unexpectedly healing’. Julien’s work meditates on the sins of the past, finding balm in the intersection of race and sexuality, not least in Lessons of the Hour (2019), his cinematic portrait of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, which was shown for eight months in New York, first at Skidmore College’s Tang Museum and then at MoMA (Julien’s iconic Looking for Langston, 1989, is also currently on show there as part of the permanent collection). Meanwhile, Julien became Fellow of the British Academy this year, and his survey exhibition, What freedom is to me, travelled to Bonnefanten, Maastrich.",

Yet his figurative paintings – often ambiguous scenes, ‘points of contention… that I don’t have a clear moral attitude on’, created not on canvas (to avoid the Western-centric history of the material) but lubugo, a Ugandan textile used in funerary rites made from fig tree bark – have found an audience internationally as much as at home. While Armitage has put much of his energy into his Nairobi Contemporary Art Institute, a nonprofit for East African art he set up in 2020, this year he won the UK Government Art Collection’s Robson Orr TenTen Award and had a solo exhibition at Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria. NCAI meanwhile has provided a platform to showcase Kenyan artists, including a retrospective of Kenyan artist Chelenge Van Rampelberg and an exhibition of Syowia Kyambi’s recent work across media.",

            "The curators of Dear Earth [https://artreview.com/ecocritical-art-hayward-dear-earth-climate-crisis-exhibition/], at London’s Hayward Gallery, said they took inspiration from Nkanga’s maxim that ‘caring is a form of resistance’, with care being afforded to both the human and nonhuman subject. In that exhibition she showed Double Plot (2018), a vast tapestry depicting the solar system, while more recent textiles, drawings, photographs, sculptures and performance works featured in solo shows at the Frist Art Museum, Nashville, and the Institut Valencià d’Art Modern. ‘Care’ is not just a modish curatorial buzzword for Nkanga, but the driving force behind O8 Black Stone, a black soap made of petrol sediment (name-checked in Teju Cole’s new book), sold in aid of her Athens project space, Akwa Ibom, and an organic farm in Nigeria that promotes biodiverse planting practices and doubles as a hub for the rural community. While shifting galleries, from Mendes Wood DM to Lisson, Nkanga remains as formally innovative as she is socially conscious, winning this year’s $100,000 Nasher Prize [https://artreview.com/otobong-nkanga-wins-the-2025-nasher-prize/] for Sculpture.",

For Singh’s work is in constant flux: the artist seeks out new arrangements from her vast archive of images and exhibits them as ‘minimuseums’ of concertinaed books and portable display walls; her unusual formatting encourages viewers to play a role in the sequencing of her photographs, allowing a democratic sensibility to permeate her work. At both the Gwangju and São Paulo [https://artreview.com/35th-bienal-de-sao-paulo-review-choreographies-of-the-impossible/] biennials this year, she presented these alongside a regular foray into moving image with Mona and Myself (2013), a video portrait of Mona, a third-gender eunuch whom Singh met during the 1980s, and who became a close friend and muse to the artist. Long before questions of gender identity were a mainstay in the artworld, Singh was investigating this, and other subjects pushed to the margins of society, with a keen eye and great empathy.",

The biennale, originally set to open in December 2024, was postponed by a year following a period of concern that it might be cancelled completely. This was due to a debt owed to the event’s waterfront venue since its first edition in 2012. These issues have now been resolved, with new private patrons coming to the rescue and a new chair (former director general of the National Museum in Delhi, Venu Vasudevan). This year the biennial, in partnership with Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation, presented the inaugural New Dialogues: Contemporary Art From South Asia conference at London’s Southbank Centre. Meanwhile, Krishnamachari, who also makes art, can now put ‘gallerist’ on his CV: in October he opened a contemporary space inside the new Bangalore store of interior design studio Dtale, showing works by Astha Butail, Harisha Chennangod, Pooja Iranna and Prajakta Potnis.",

            "Ninagawa was one of a number of dealers who set up shop during the 2000s as Japan was coming out of its ‘lost decade’ of economic decline: not an easy moment to start selling art. Yet her gallery, Take Ninagawa, thrived and now represents the likes of Shinro Ohtake and Aki Sasamoto [https://artreview.com/aki-sasamoto-point-reflection-queens-museum-new-york-sounding-lines-para-site-hong-kong/] from Japan, and Wang Bing [https://artreview.com/wang-bing-filmmaking-is-not-that-complicated/], Danh Vo and Ken Okiishi from abroad. In October she opened an exhibition of work by Ryoko Aoki, ready for Art Week Tokyo, the fourth edition of the annual citywide festival pioneered by Ninagawa herself. Now staged in collaboration with Art Basel (Ninagawa sits on the fair’s selection committee for its Basel edition), the event draws an international crowd and is eager to establish a new hub in Asia to rival Seoul and away from the censorship present in Hong Kong and mainland China. Over 50 galleries and museums across the city took part in the event, which included a selling show at Okura Museum of Art curated by Mami Kataoka, and AWT Video, a series of moving image works programmed by Sohrab Mohebbi that screened at SMBC East Tower.",

In May they collaborated again for Calel’s solo [https://artreview.com/edgar-calel-balabaj-jaguar-stone-sculpture-center-new-york-review/] at New York’s SculptureCenter (which Mohebbi directs). Challenging Western artistic hegemonies, Calel’s work often sits somewhere between artwork and ritual, foregrounding an Indigenous cosmological worldview. He made news in 2021 by allowing Tate to be custodians of Ru k’ox k’ob’el jun ojer etemab’el (The Echo of an Ancient Form of Knowledge, 2021), a work that involved the invocation of his ancestors – which also appeared in this year’s Liverpool Biennial [https://artreview.com/liverpool-biennial-2023-review-tending-to-the-wound/]. At the Gwangju Biennale, Calel showed a new iteration of the work, and at the Bienal de São Paulo [https://artreview.com/35th-bienal-de-sao-paulo-review-choreographies-of-the-impossible/] the artist presented an installation of embroideries representing the collective architecture and rituals of the Brazilian Guarani community.",

Fostering critical discussions within the art scene in Ghana, while building international connections, this amorphous collective acts as an exhibition platform and support network, modelling a form of headless institution. Beyond its Kumasi project space are exchange programmes with art schools in Germany, and residency swaps in Denmark and Uganda. Historical survey Ghana 1957: Art After Independence was cocurated by Kwasi Ohene-Ayeh in Accra, while the group collaborated with Berlin’s SAVVY Contemporary in shaping part of its Transitions project. Members often swap seamlessly between the roles of artist and curator, such as Tracy Naa Koshie Thompson, who cocurated a two-part exhibition at Gallery 1957’s London and Accra spaces, then took part in the Busan Biennale [https://artreview.com/busan-biennale-2024-seeing-in-the-dark-review-mark-rappolt/], and Bernard Akoi-Jackson, who organised Elolo Bosoka’s show at Accra’s Museum of Science and Technology, and whose work is currently on display in the photography biennial Bamako Encounters.",

Unshackled, Ahmed has become one of the most important voices in feminist and queer-activist discourse, especially when it involves exposing hypocrisy within supposedly liberal, progressive institutions. This year, publication of The Feminist Killjoy Handbook offered a practical guide to rocking the boat, which includes ‘being willing to confront institutional problems… and to challenge how [institutions] use our efforts to change them as evidence they have changed’. She has been supporting the book with a lecture tour of university campuses in the US and elsewhere. Her messages, such as ‘I like to call diversity practitioners institutional plumbers’ – offering temporary fixes that are in turn claimed and trumpeted loudly by management – have resonated in the staffrooms of museums and galleries internationally.",

            "“I try to live and participate with minimal dissonance between my existence as a thinker and as a compassionate being trying to make sense of my survival in this world,” Nwagbogu told ArtReview [https://artreview.com/azu-nwagbogu-on-representing-the-republic-of-benin-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] this year of his mode of curating. This holistic approach is necessary when dealing with themes such as the slave trade, the figure of the Amazon and the Vodun religion, as the curator did for the first Benin Pavilion [https://artreview.com/venice-biennale-2024-a-guide-to-the-arsenale/#:~:text=and%20heritage%2C%20the-,Republic%20of%20Benin,-makes%20its%20debut] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] (featuring the work of Chloé Quenum, Moufouli Bello, Ishola Akpo and Romuald Hazoumè). The founder and director of African Artists’ Foundation, the 16-year-old nonprofit arts organisation, and Lagos Photo Festival has been preoccupied with questions of survival: in 2020 the foundation was evicted from its base by its landlords, unfairly it claims, which has put its activities on hiatus. Meanwhile, a new iteration of Dig Where You Stand – From Coast to Coast, a roaming and evolving exhibition project about decolonisation, restitution and repatriation, which Nwagbogu initiated in 2022, landed this year in Benin.",

This included artefacts of American pop culture, Arabic literature, punk cinema, childhood drawings and photographs relating to the artist’s childhood, spent between Washington State and the Middle East. The show also featured her trilogy Beast Type Song (2019), which was the subject of a solo at Turku Art Museum in Finland; Tender Point Ruin (2021); and Tiger Strike Red (2022), lo-fi sci-fi works that present possible futures haunted by imperialist pasts, dystopias threaded through with the hope of what she has called ‘counter-histories’. As the Emirates increases its footprint in the arts, Al-Maria has emerged as one of the region’s most prescient voices. Her interest in future ruins was evident too in the video she made for Miu Miu and the Italian fashion house’s Spring/Summer 2024 runway show.",

Increasingly present in the gallery as much as the cinema, Apichatpong saw over seven hours of his short films exhibited across Kiang Malingue’s two Hong Kong premises at the start of the year (the dealer went on to take them to various art fairs, including a screening at Art Basel Hong Kong). Yet Apichatpong is perhaps most comfortable on set, among the lush landscapes he had made his own, and in August he returned to the forest, specifically the jungles of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, to lead a ten day Herzogesque workshop for emerging filmmakers; next year he will be in Sri Lanka, making a film inspired by Arthur C. Clarke, cowriter of the screenplay for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and longtime resident of the country.",

Musician Herndon and artist partner Dryhust have been ahead of that particular question for years; Herndon’s clear-sighted experiments into AI songmaking resulted in Holly+, her ‘digital twin’, who can reshape existing songs in Herndon’s own voice. (Herndon is also on the 2024 jury for the Paris-based IRCAM’s prestigious Generative Music Prize.) As the implications of AI learning from art made by humans become clearer, the pair have been vocal advocates [https://artreview.com/ai-art-and-the-problem-of-consent/] of artists’ rights; in March their online tool – allowing artists to check if their work has been used to train AI models, and opt out – attracted 40,000 signatories, with several AI companies agreeing to respect artists’ wishes, including Stability AI. It’s no wonder that Herndon made Time magazine’s ‘100 AI’ list in September. As Dryhurst told Freethink magazine, ‘I don’t see any conflict between being very, very excited about… machine learning, and also being very loyal to or concerned about artist welfare’.",

Their latest work, Night Fishing with Ancestors (2023), shown this year at solo exhibitions at Secession in Vienna, the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and Goldsmiths CCA in London, as well as various screenings internationally, is typical, loosely centring on the story of eighteenth-century Macassan traders who sailed to the Australian coast from Indonesia to collect sea cucumbers, a moment of collaborative trade before the extractivist violence of white colonialism. As much as the content of their productions has won praise, woozily mixing documentary, sci-fi and humour, so has their decentred way of working, in which profits from screenings and prizes are ploughed into the development of their own community and their ongoing attempts to reclaim land from the Australian state.",

            "‘It is a collective mission to emancipate and change mentalities that society may have about artists of African origin,’ Ibrahim told Vogue of her relationship with her artists. This mission started in Chicago with Ibrahim’s gallery in 2019, before expanding to Paris in 2021 and this year [https://artreview.com/mariane-ibrahim-to-open-third-gallery-space/] opening in stately Mexico City premises, complete with Porfiriato facade. Along the way she has brought attention to many of the new stars of the Black figurative painting renaissance, not least Ghanaians Amoako Boafo and Zohra Opoku, and Nigerian Peter Uka (who showed at the Paris gallery in October). The CDMX gallery opened with an exhibition of Hawaiian-born, locally based Clotilde Jiménez’s largescale cubist-inflected collages, paintings and ceramics. Ibrahim is winning fans: veteran conceptualist Lorraine O’Grady quit her mainstay representative Alexander Gray Associates for the gallery, even as an expansive retrospective tours American museums, while Ibrahim debuted Haitian painter Patrick Eugène at the Chicago space in April.",

            "On closing her four-venue European travelling show at Tate Britain in February, Yiadom-Boakye was confirmed as one of Britain’s foremost painters, leaving critics enamoured with her oil paintings of timeless figures – all Black, some posed, some acting out everyday playful scenes. ‘A living old master’, The Guardian reckoned. ‘Her touch is sublime. She animates a face with a few marks and patches of bare canvas,’ commented the Evening Standard. ‘[A] very, very good painter. Thick and rough with the brush but just precise enough,’ thought Time Out. Ever prolific, she went on in March to fill the Guggenheim Bilbao with a selection of over 70 paintings and charcoal drawings, all shown for the first time and made in the last three years. Being one of the leading practitioners of Black figuration comes with commercial success too: her 2015 painting Six Birds in the Bush, a portrait of a young Black man sporting a purple feather in his hat and who appears as though caught in a daydream, sold for £2.95m at Sotheby’s in October.",

The book, which has evolved from the Feral Atlas online project, considers (as has come to be expected from the UC Santa Cruz professor), the unexpected outcomes and responsibilities of humanity’s methods of populating and extracting from the planet – as told through the nonhuman presence of, for example, beetles, water hyacinths and dry rot fungus. While this year saw publication of a new edition of her 2004 book Friction, using forest fires in Indonesia to reflect on globalisation, her more recent articles and talks have focused on concrete and how its use in the built environment precipitates floods. As climates continue to shift, artists continue to look to Tsing to help map the new terrain.",

The artist’s comment relates to his interest in taking money out of the West, through the sale of such sculptures, and funnelling it back into Tamale, the region of northern Ghana where the artist was raised and still lives. There he has built three institutions [https://artreview.com/ibrahim-mahama-builds-museums-of-the-future/], Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art, Red Clay Studio and Nkrumah Volini, each with its own programme of exhibitions and education initiatives. This reparative practice has won him fans: institutional shows this year include Fruitmarket, Edinburgh; Barbican Centre, London; and Mönchehaus Museum Goslar; while newly commissioned works were presented at the Lagos Biennial and Desert X AlUla, Saudi Arabia.",

            "Russell, director of New York nonprofit space The Kitchen, published Black Meme: A History of the Images that Make Us this year, a book that follows the internet-plus-identity model established by her 2020 debut Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto. In Black Meme, Russell traces how, from the days of silent cinema to TikTok and GIFs, the Black subject has been reduced to archetype, not least via the hyperviolent ‘viral’ imagery of slain figures such as Emmett Till or Philando Castile, while likening the distribution of souvenir postcards of public lynchings to the sharing of memes. Russell isn’t just commenting on visual culture; she has a mission to change it. She told Vanity Fair, ‘Many people would agree that the artworld is in a state of disarray… We’re seeing many failures and also through those failures many opportunities to change.’ This year, the curator’s group show on ‘black data’, Code Switch: Distributing Blackness, Reprogramming Internet Art, organised by The Kitchen across various US venues, and a presentation at Berggruen Arts & Culture in Venice by artist and poet Rhea Dillon helped further that cause.",

In 15 years the Rajas have not only built and established two galleries in the city and a third in Mumbai, but also an entire ecosystem, created through the Experimenter Curators’ Hub, which held its 14th edition this year; their online learning-orientated Experimenter Labs; Experimenter Books; an outpost exhibition programme that ‘inhabits disused, characterful spaces’; and the Generator Co-operative Art Production Fund, which offers small bursaries for art production. TRI opened with solo shows by Experimenter artists Prabhakar Pachpute and Kallol Datta, while at the same time during Mumbai Gallery Weekend the Rajas staged exhibitions by Afrah Shafiq and Alexandra Bachzetsis, and camp’s monumental 2022 seven-channel installation Bombay Tilts Down could be seen in the open air down at the city’s docks. This autumn, Sohrab Hura opened his first US survey show at New York’s MoMA PS1.",

            "Upending the classics seems to be the theme this year for the multidisciplinary artist, who embraces a state of in-betweenness both in terms of personal identity and in the mediums of her projects, which variously include filmmaking, performance and installation. Over the past five years she has been scandalising conservative critics and audiences at the stately Swiss theatre Schauspielhaus Zürich in her role as a guest director by staging avant-garde updates to canonical works including Orpheus (2021), Pinocchio (2022) and The Tempest (2024), while increasing gender and racial diversity in the productions. (The magnificent Moby-Dick; or, The Whale [https://artreview.com/wu-tsang-of-whales-thyssen-bornemisza-museo-nacional-madrid-moby-dick-review/], 2022, a silent film retelling Herman Melville’s novel, premiered there, and has since travelled the world to acclaim.) Together with her longtime collaborators, the open collective Moved by the Motion, Wu closed her stint at the Schauspielhaus with a hybrid operatic-theatrical take on Georges Bizet’s 1875 Carmen. The show received mixed reviews – but judging by the upcoming touring schedule of Wu’s projects, she’ll be keeping busy.",

His research culminated in a survey show this year at Goldsmiths CCA in London, which featured, among other things, a new commission that drew connections between extraction and Belgian art nouveau, and a collaborative performance that recounted the story of the first Black bishop appointed by the Catholic Church in the fifteenth century. But Baloji’s actual power lies in his role as a catalyst for his hometown’s art scene: as a cofounder of an independent association that supports local artists, Atelier Picha, he has been instrumental in establishing the Lubumbashi Biennale, which launched its 8th edition in October under the title Towards an Antidote to Toxicity. Focusing on the legacy of Congolese thinker Valentin-Yves Mudimbe, this year’s iteration seeks to imagine the possibilities of anticolonial engagement with the colonial archive through the works of artists from across the country and beyond.",

In March Essers supported a show of Lindokuhle Sobekwa’s photographs at the Johannesburg Art Gallery; while the Cape Town space held exhibitions for multimedia artists Mikhael Subotzky and Alfredo Jaar. The London gallery opened a survey of the late painter Atta Kwami, which moved to the New York space, complementing its inaugural full year of programming, featuring Misheck Masamvu, Zineb Sedira and Kapwani Kiwanga, among others. Meanwhile, visitors to the Cheetah Plains luxury safari lodge on the Sabi Sand Nature Reserve may have gone for the lions and leopards, but could stay for the art: in January it opened a private art gallery in partnership with Goodman Gallery, to the delight of its the wildlife-hungry holidaymakers.",

He’s also a stylist whose steady stream of digestibly short, aphorism-filled books pair well with social media-tinged attention spans. Titling his 2023 book Via Contemplativa: In Praise of Inactivity might seem a little at odds, coming from such a prolific writer, though it’s a paean to the unhurried contemplation of reality, rather than commendation for doing nothing at all. And if said reality gives you the shivers, this year the Korean-German thinker published the Anselm Kiefer-illustrated The Spirit of Hope – ‘a plea against the crisis of fear’ by the same writer who also in 2024 put out The Crisis of Narration, which lamented the loss of richly complex storytelling and the social media-fuelled shift towards ‘storyselling’. Problems everywhere, then, but it’s all grist to Han’s fast-moving diagnostic mill.",

While Forge holds its own collection, its programme is one led not by exhibitions but residencies, community days, discussion events and collaborative meals, shaping what an art institution can become from an Indigenous perspective. Meanwhile, Hopkins [https://artreview.com/forge-project-indigenous-self-determination-reimagining-art-pedagogy-candice-hopkins-shanna-ketchum-heap-of-birds-interview/] also secured a $175,000 grant for climate action from the Teiger Foundation, curated a show at the Nanaimo Art Gallery in her home territory of British Columbia and continued as Fellow in Indigenous Art History and Curatorial Studies at CCS Bard.",

On the Boston waterfront the artist placed Last Garment (2022), a bronze sculpture based on a nineteenth-century Jamaican washerwoman. The exhibition travelled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, in November, and a new edition of another Venice work by Leigh, Sentinel (2022), entered the collection of the city’s National Gallery of Art in August. Such institutional acclaim naturally helps the bottom line: in May Leigh’s 2019 bronze Stick sold for a record $2.7m at auction.",

In 2023, while continuing to sit on the board of KW Institute, Stoschek oversaw shows by underknown septuagenarian Black video artist Ulysses Jenkins and emerging South Korean multimedia artist Young-jun Tak, a six-decade survey of video-based performance art and a Hans Ulrich Obrist-curated exploration of the intersection between art and videogames. Meanwhile, after a 2022 marred by revelations of her great-grandfather’s wartime involvement with the Nazi Party, this year Stoschek sought to redirect the narrative forwards, her foundation announcing a long-term resource-sharing collaboration with the Düsseldorf Art Academy. For someone so frequently invested in art’s present and near future, it’s an on-brand move.",

She was not just talking about a global reach that spans from Hollywood to Hong Kong to Gstaad to New York, nor the 103 artists and artists’ estates the gallery promotes (veterans William Kentridge, Jeffrey Gibson [https://artreview.com/jeffrey-gibsons-indigenous-futurism/] and Nairy Baghramian joined the roster this year, as well as youngster George Rouy and Michaela Yearwood-Dan). The trio have also established themselves as lifestyle purveyors via their ‘art centres’ in Somerset and Menorca, and, above all, through Iwan and Manuela’s loss-leading Artfarm hospitality company, which owns restaurants, hotels, pubs and, not least, London’s Groucho Club, all adorned with the work of gallery artists. If, as one cynic put it, also to the FT, ‘galleries are event organisers for rich and lonely people’, then Hauser & Wirth definitely fills the void.",

            "‘When I was little, I understood that my thoughts were different, and I decided not to live colonized,’ the Chilean artist told Casa Vogue this year. Vicuña suffered as a result, for decades often at the brink of destitution but continuing nonetheless with her knotted textile sculptures, agitprop paintings and poetry. Now the world is eager to listen, what with the eco-feminist and Indigenous turn in artmaking that Vicuña’s work has always embodied. Dreaming Water, one of several recent retrospectives, which opened in Santiago and Buenos Aires last year, arrived at the Pinacoteca of São Paulo in May, while Pérez Art Museum Miami installed a nine-metre quipus, one of the artist’s cascading sculptures of unspun wool. Her work was present in 15 group shows this year, including Pacific Standard Time, California, and two biennials (Malta and Toronto). In addition, the artist presented spoken word performances at venues including Triple Canopy, New York; Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; and Tate Britain, London. In November, Vicuña was awarded $100,000 as a recipient [https://artreview.com/julian-charriere-and-cecilia-vicuna-win-inaugural-environment-and-art-prize/] of the inaugural MoCA Los Angeles Eric and Wendy Schmidt Environment and Art Prize.",

            "This research group, founded in 2010 by Israeli architect Eyal Weizman [https://artreview.com/eyal-weizman-why-aesthetics-must-mean-more-than-beauty/] and consisting of over 20 artists, architects, journalists and researchers who investigate human rights violations, has never been busier. The group has long worked in Palestine, and in January the first exhibition of its Ramallah-based offshoot, the Forensic Architecture Investigation (FAI) Unit, was staged at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Arts and Sciences. The exhibition displayed its trademark analysis of found field recordings, media imagery and satellite pictures, as well as 3D animated reconstructions used to create second-by-second retellings of contested events. The unit, set up in 2020, is a collaboration with Al-Haq, a human rights organisation, but one that has been designated a terrorist group by Israel’s Ministry of Defense, and Forensic Architecture has been the subject of much criticism from commentators, particularly in Germany. Shows at Württembergische Kunstverein Stuttgart and Museum im Kulturspeicher (MiK), Würzburg, both concerning racist and anti-immigration violence in Germany, went ahead, however.\n\nThe methodology they pioneered, in applying aesthetic analysis to news and events, has proven widely influential, while affiliates and former members, including artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan [https://artreview.com/artist/lawrence-abu-hamdan/] and curator Anselm Franke, have spread this further in their own work. Positioning artistic tools and interdisciplinary creative research as means to generate evidence of what they term ‘state and corporate violence’, their work’s proposal of art as something that can be instrumentalised is apparently an alluring one for many artists, suggesting art installation as antidote to an image-dominated, post-truth landscape. The current show at CIVA, Brussels, shows their 2023 work on prehistoric architecture in what is now Ukraine; their work on former plantations in Louisiana, USA, becoming petrochemical factories on view at the Wellcome Collection, London; and a selection of their ongoing work on medical staff in Gaza over the past year being exhibited in Vienna. Alongside museum exhibitions also in Istanbul, Portland and Cali, and biennials in Rotterdam and Yogyakarta, their work continues to have both global focus and audiences.",

            "Hartman’s self-stated mission statement to ‘reckon with the lives undone and obliterated in the making of human commodities’ has made her a vital commentator on the consequences of slavery – and a signal example to artists exploring whitewashed narratives of history. Her reach is wide: a new Japanese translation of the writer, thinker and cultural historian’s 2006 book Lose Your Mother won Japan’s Best Translation Award this year. All of this continues to spread her work and her influential methods of delving into archives, exploring their gaps and absences, and reanimating them with both academic rigor and the tools of fiction, what she refers to as ‘critical fabulation’. Her aim in 2019’s Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments [https://artreview.com/can-there-be-history-without-facts-feature-izabella-scott/#:~:text=The%20US%20scholar%20Saidiya%20Hartman], as she wrote, of ‘reconstructing the experience of the unknown and retrieving minor lives from oblivion’ could also be read as a guide for many artists working today.\n\nThis year, while teaching in the English Department at Columbia University and continuing work on a book about unsung heroes of Black radicalism (under the title Graces of the Unsung), and alongside her inclusion in the publication Five Manifestos for the Beautiful World (2024, based on a lecture series from last year), Hartman resumed her ongoing collaboration with artist Arthur Jafa [https://artreview.com/artist/arthur-jafa/?year=2020] through an ambitious three-part multimedia performance, Minor Music at the End of the World. Commissioned by Hartwig Art Foundation and currently in rehearsal, with theorist Tina Campt involved as dramaturg, the production is based on two of Hartman’s essays, ‘The End of White Supremacy: An American Romance’ and ‘Litany for Grieving Sisters’. It also draws on the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, particularly his science fiction story ‘The Comet’, published in 1920 in the wake of the Great Influenza pandemic, in which a black man and a white woman are the sole survivors of an apocalyptic event. Hartman and Jafa’s work will premiere in Amsterdam next year, and the questions it promises to raise testify to Hartman’s conceptual scope and hopefulness: ‘How does one live at the end of the world? Is it possible to envision a world without racism? And what would be required to produce such a world?’",

They opened the Muholi Art Institute in Cape Town last year, offering residencies lasting six months to a year, with a stipend, housing and studio costs covered; the fruits of which were featured in an exhibition at Jonathan Carver Moore gallery in San Francisco in June. In February the institute presented a group exhibition, EMBODYING #HER, spotlighting the work of established and emerging women-identifying and queer artists.",

Weems, who was awarded the US National Medal of Arts [https://artreview.com/carrie-mae-weems-awarded-2024-national-medal-of-arts/] by the departing President Biden in October, also revisited The Kitchen Table, her 1990 series of images capturing a fictional drama featuring the artist herself amid scenes of Black American domestic life. She referenced the project in a commission for fashion brand Bottega Veneta, with a campaign showing rapper A$AP Rocky and his baby child sitting down for dinner. Two works from the original series were included in a tv advertisement for Kamala Harris, and Weems produced a billboard for the Democratic presidential candidate, as well as hosting a programme of readings, live music and food at New York’s Gladstone Gallery on election day.",

What is not yet on the agenda, but will be in the near future? The event was a prelude to next year’s Infinite Ecologies Marathon, marking ten years of climate-focused events organised by Pietroiusti at the Serpentine, and representative of the curator’s belief that art can platform cross-disciplinary ideas on tackling the climate crisis. One of the leading ecologically minded curators, she is a regular on the panel discussion and jury circuit. This year she curated a screening programme for a ‘more-than-human curiosity’ symposium in the Czech Republic, and serves as a trustee of the Gallery Climate Coalition, which includes hundreds of galleries and institutions worldwide. Sun & Sea (Marina) [https://artreview.com/climate-crisis-opera-sun-sea-what-you-do-end-of-world/], the ‘climate change’ opera she curated for the 2019 Lithuanian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, also continues its seemingly never-ending global tour: Taipei, Paris, Cork, Vienna, Buenos Aires, Santiago and Sydney this year.",

            "The Samdanis’ Dhaka Art Summit has made the Bangladeshi capital a regular destination in the artworld calendar – its sixth edition in February attracting 572,000 visitors to see the work of 120 local and international artists. How does that square with a country likely to feel the effects of the climate emergency most sharply? It is something the summit addressed head-on with works, curated by Campbell, ranging from Joydeb Roaja’s largescale immersive installation addressing environmental displacement to puppetry performances by children that reflected on climate change. The Samdanis are also establishing the Srihatta, their permanent foundation and sculpture park in rural Bangladesh, delayed but set to open to the public and for artist residencies next year. Away from Bangladesh, Nadia received the Order of Arts and Letters from French Ministry of Culture, and Campbell took control of Desert X in the Coachella Valley in March, again on the climatic beat, linking droughts and floods in California and Bangladesh.",

If the Indonesian collective hoped to return to lives not under constant scrutiny – no such luck: Documenta put out apologetic statements after two members ‘liked’ a social media post depicting a pro-Palestine celebration the day of Hamas’s attack on Israel (Reza Afisina and Iswanto Hartono, both currently visiting professors at the University of Fine Arts Hamburg, also apologised, saying they mistakenly thought the video showed police breaking up the demonstration). Despite the controversies, and while less overtly and creatively active this year, their mode of nonhierarchical working is spreading, both through inspiration and ongoing collaborations: Momentum 12 [https://artreview.com/momentum-12-announces-participating-artists/], the Norwegian biennial, made explicit reference to their project by including the archives of Gudskul, the free art school the collective operates in Jakarta, as did Asia Art Archive’s exhibition The Collective School.",

He created Listening All Night to the Rain, a disorientating walk-through featuring 62 screens that played 31 hours of footage and archival material, with references ranging from Stokely Carmichael to Mark Rothko, and which meditated on the artist’s enduring themes of memory, migration, racial injustice and climate change, while asking audiences to ‘attune’ to an ‘ethics of sonics’ that served as the installation’s narrative. Akomfrah’s interest in the formal texture of filmmaking, as much as its social and political message, was honed not least during his years as a member of the Black Audio Film Collective (with former members David Lawson and Lina Gopaul still working alongside him). The Independent thought the Pavilion was ‘a visual feast, exploring the best and worst of our country at a time when the notion of British identity has never been so contested’.",

While her videos, performances and, most recently, virtual reality works continue to speak to technological progress and the transformation of China, it is the human experience in all of this that fascinates her the most – and has led to her staying power. ‘I come from the pre-internet era,’ she has said, ‘and what moves me is the relationship formed through emotions, people, objects and the world, not only algorithms and data.’ It is this broadness in her curiosity that registers with audiences, not least those visiting the Lenbachhaus in Munich, where her work explored the relationship between digital culture and the real and virtual worlds. The artist also had solo exhibitions at SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (where the artist transformed the galleries into, for example, a Beijing cinema foyer and a yum cha restaurant, with the help of Hong Kong-based Beau Architects) and Museum of Art Pudong in Shanghai, the last being Cao’s largest to date.",

But Preciado remains, as ever, the intellectual face for the instabilities of gender and biopolitics, and a world that’s in transition. Often cited by artists, Preciado’s work made its way into the Spanish Pavilion [https://artreview.com/venice-biennale-2024-a-guide-to-the-giardini/#:~:text=dense%20and%20captivating-,Spain%20Pavilion,-presents%20hundreds%20of] at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/category/venice-biennale-2024/] this year, where Sandra Gamarra [https://artreview.com/sandra-gamarra-heshiki-on-representing-spain-at-the-60th-venice-biennale/] took a sentence from a lecture by the thinker to accompany a work she had made: ‘trans body is to normative heterosexuality what Palestine is to the West: a colony whose extension and form is perpetuated only through violence’.",

            "‘The greatest love that the human species has attained was on a Gucci shoot, when I was shooting a trans couple making love,’ Goldin proclaimed in October. After the pain of her opioid addiction, and the crusade to bring down the Sackler family (museum patrons who made their fortune through the prescription opioid Oxycontin), the photographer was rewarded with a campaign for the fashion brand (an emotional moment, apparently, featuring the likes of Debbie Harry). Alongside her first big-bucks commercial deal was a show of older work presented by Gagosian at the Welsh Chapel in London, while her dealer’s New York space premiered two of her newest moving image works: the apocalyptic You never did anything wrong, in which the models are all animals, and Stendhal Syndrome (both 2024), which pairs personal photographs with portraits of masterpieces from famous museums (now devoid of Sackler sponsorship, naturally). Does this represent a mellowing? Not at all: in October Goldin was arrested outside the New York Stock Exchange [https://artreview.com/nan-goldin-among-artists-arrested-at-jewish-voice-for-peace-action/] while protesting Israel’s bombardment of Palestine.",

This year found the 2020 MacArthur genius-grant awardee taking time out from lecturing on performance studies at NYU (as well as his fellowship at Harvard and other-coast gig at UC Riverside) to lecture on subjects including the poetics of W.E.B. Du Bois and to participate in the Harvard conference ‘Jews and Black Theory: Conceptualizing Otherness’. (In a report on the latter, his performance-inflected keynote was described as a talk that ‘defies summarizing’.) But Moten, who has historically collaborated with artists such as Wu Tsang [https://artreview.com/artist/wu-tsang/], is himself as much a creative maker as a parser of ideas. In 2024, in addition to giving onstage poetry readings (he’s now published ten books of verse), he released and gigged the blacksmiths, the flowers, his second album alongside jazz rhythm section Brandon López and Gerald Cleaver, with Moten – who else – taking care of the words.",

While her Biennale remains a touchstone of how to handle a largescale, in-depth exhibition, this year she has collaborated with various commercial sidelines within spitting distance of the High Line, New York, where she is director. Alemani’s commissions at the latter include work by Pamela Rosenkranz, Yu Ji and Gabriel Chaile, among others. At Gagosian, just a block from the linear sculpture park’s entrance, Alemani curated a Tetsuya Ishida retrospective, featuring more than 80 of the late Japanese artist’s nightmarishly surreal paintings. And a mere two blocks further on, at the old Dia Chelsea premises, Alemani staged an exhibition of work by 70 women artists owned by collectors Komal Shah and Gaurav Garg (which will travel to California’s Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive and the Kemper Art Museum in St Louis). Whether the carbon-footprint-conscious Alemani left Chelsea to sit on the jury of Canada’s Sobey prize [https://artreview.com/kablusiak-wins-2023-sobey-art-award/] is unknown.",

            "A collection of venetian blinds were at the centre of Yang’s recent solo exhibition at London’s Hayward Gallery. This staple object, used by the artist for nearly 20 years, framed a videowork in which she revisits the abandoned house that served as the venue for her first solo exhibition in South Korea in 2006. Featuring an installation formed from drying racks, origami pieces and light fixtures, that historic – and self-initiated – show set the tone for a career in which the architectural detritus of the everyday has been used to poetically reference art historical moments, political events or folk rituals. The Hayward exhibition garnered a one-star review in The Guardian but plenty of praise elsewhere: Yang’s fans are legion, demonstrated by the fact that the London exhibition wasn’t her only museum outing this year. She received a survey show, titled Flat Works, of collages, prints and paintings spanning two decades at the Arts Club of Chicago, and was included in the Lahore Biennale as well as group exhibitions at Secession, Vienna, and MoMA, New York, among others.",

            "In January the American filmmaker was ruminating on being a Black artist adored by museums. ‘We could come in there saying, “We just want to be one of the guys, we just want to be a part of the canon,” but they know we don’t know how to do anything but break shit. We come to fuck shit up.’ That fucking up of shit takes the form of mesmerising films concerning Blackness, death and history. At LUMA Westbau, in Zurich, he remixed his 2013 work APEX, slowing down the original eight-minute video collage to 33 minutes and adding accompanying beats by Detroit techno pioneer Robert Hood. A newfound interest in abstraction was present in LOML (2022), which paid homage to the late writer and musician Greg Tate, shown at the Gwangju Biennale. Meanwhile Melbourne audiences got the greatest hits, including Love is the Message, The Message is Death [https://artreview.com/work-of-the-week-arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message/] (2016), at the Fiona and Sidney Myer Gallery, and last year’s survey [https://artreview.com/a-guide-to-arts-and-culture-this-november/] at OGR Torino closed in February. Meanwhile a collaboration with Supreme became mired in controversy when the fashion brand’s creative director departed, citing the company’s ‘systemic racism’.",

They write, ‘political morality takes time, a patient and courageous way of learning and naming’, a slowness lost in the media churn of outrage and easy condemnation. Considerations such as these come naturally to the Gender Trouble (1990) author and comparative literature professor at UC Berkeley, who remains a champion of queer and gender theory, and who published The Livable and the Unlivable this year (coauthored with Frédéric Worms), a treatise on intersectional care in the face of identity-based and ecological violence. It was these subjects and more that they picked up with a series of speakers – among them philosophers Paul B. Preciado, Elsa Dorlin, Hourya Bentouhami and psychoanalyst Monique David-Ménard – in the first of their events organised as part of being the 2023–24 intellectual-in-residence at the Pompidou in Paris.",

Where the former used to be the purview of rightwing commentators (The Telegraph’s recent frothing at the museum spending £21,000 ‘on discarded avocado trays’, namely Veronica Ryan’s Arrangement In Layers, Stacking Up Moments I–X, 2016–19, felt like a throwback), Balshaw now must keep an eye out for any controversy that might blow up around the perceived ethics of private funders and sponsors (she’s not averse to making the point herself, using her new book, Gathering of Strangers: Why Museums Matter [https://artreview.com/the-unfortunate-ironies-of-maria-balshaws-gathering-of-strangers/], to criticise the British Museum for taking money from BP). Tate Modern had shows of work by Mike Kelley [https://artreview.com/remaking-mike-kelley-tate-modern-martin-herbert/] and Yoko Ono [https://artreview.com/yoko-ono-music-of-the-mind-tate-modern-review/], while Zanele Muholi returned just three years after their major survey to show new works; Alvaro Barrington received the Tate Britain commission; and Sámi artist Outi Pieski showed at Tate St Ives. Tate Liverpool [https://artreview.com/tate-liverpool-to-close-for-over-a-year/] remained closed for a refurbishment.",

A Woman You Thought You Knew, which brought together works from the Kadist collection, was staged at the nonprofit’s gallery in San Francisco, while its Paris gallery boasted a programme that featured an evening of performances inspired by medieval French poetry, Manthia Diawara and Hoor Al Qasimi [https://artreview.com/artist/sheikha-hoor-al-qasimi/] in conversation, and a group show of Ukrainian artists in collaboration with the Palais de Tokyo. Partech Africa is the largest fund dedicated to African startups, and Kadist has been increasingly present on the continent.

Mousse magazine even cited her when announcing its redesign this year. Though it has been a quiet year for publishing, with limited public speaking beyond her professor emerita role at the History of Consciousness department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, it’s understandable why she remains such a touchstone: her writing addresses so many of our current issues, from the environment, to gender and queer identity, to AI and tech. Haraway’s thinking is nothing if not intersectional: regarding her papal citation, coming despite her long history of criticising the Catholic Church, she quipped, ‘Some baby Jesuit who’s into animal studies and science studies and feminist theory for some weird reason has been reading me’. They’re not alone.",

Lee’s approach, which has focused on organising prominent international exhibitions, including collateral shows at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], made their name – as well as her own. Now that Seoul has become a major node in the art market, Lee, whose gallery was founded in 1982 and represents approximately 50 artists, including Haegue Yang and the newly signed eighty-nine-year-old sculptor Kim Yun Shin (featured in this year’s Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/]), is more ambivalent about how helpful artworld hype can be. ‘I think we should not be “too excited” about the Korean art scene being globally recognized, becoming another art hub in Asia… Both galleries and artists should stay on their toes,’ she warned The Korea Herald. Now a family affair, with Lee’s children involved, Kukje is no doubt in it for the long haul.",

He remained in charge, however, of the K11 Art Foundation, which holds exhibitions in its various branded venues (tied to New World’s property portfolio) and arranges discussion forums – labelled ‘Salons’, this year in Seoul, London and Saudi Arabia – as well as artist residences. Also in 2024: the inaugural K11 Artist Prize, designed to support emerging Asian artists and spearheaded by the foundation’s International Council, featuring prominent collectors Sarah Arison and Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo [https://artreview.com/artist/patrizia-sandretto-re-rebaudengo/], and cultural strategist Alia Al-Senussi among its members. Cheng said his resignation permits him more time for public service, which includes chairing the Hong Kong government’s Mega Arts and Cultural Events Committee, responsible for providing incentives to major international events (such as Art Basel’s HK edition), and the various museum boards he attends, including New York’s MoMA PS1 and the Met, Paris’s Centre Pompidou and London’s Tate and Royal Academy of Arts.",

With its rakish reputation, the gallery was always going to be at home in the Marais in Paris, where it opened a fourth official space in October with a group show that typically mixed Brazilian and international names. ‘Official’ because the restless trio don’t tend to contain themselves solely to their addresses in São Paulo (a warehouse mothership), Brussels (opened in 2017) and their New York TriBeCa gallery. They spent their summer staging a group show at a seventeenth-century church in the bucolic Dutch coastal village of Retranchement, with a large group show of works on paper by artists including Michael Dean and Mariana Castillo Deball; while a show by painter Marina Perez Simão was the fourth to be staged at Villa Era, a nineteenth-century estate in the Italian countryside. Now they’ve refurbished a property in Upstate New York for residencies, starting with Paulo Nazareth and Paulo Monteiro.",

At least in part, the growing mightiness of the African artworld is down to the curator’s own efforts. As the director of Cape Town’s Zeitz MOCAA since 2019, and having established her name through the RAW Material Company in Senegal, Kouoh has become a leading light at home and abroad. Current shows at the institution include solos for Ghanaian-American artist Rita Mawuena Benissan [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-november-2024/#:~:text=Rita%20Mawuena%20Benissan] and South African Nolan Oswald Dennis. Earlier this year, Kunstmuseum Basel opened When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting [https://artreview.com/a-century-of-black-figuration-in-painting-review/], a survey exhibition curated by Kouoh that debuted at Zeitz. Not that it has all been plain sailing: in June, the artist Tracey Rose lambasted Kouoh and Kunstmuseum Bern, claiming that a work about Palestine had been censored [https://artreview.com/kunstmuseum-bern-hosting-tracey-rose-retrospective-branded-despicable-by-artist/] in her solo show at the Swiss institution, curated by Kouoh. Earlier this year, Kouoh oversaw Zeitz MOCAA’s annual gala, the proceeds of which help fund its educational and curatorial programming.",

The Financial Times agreed: ‘Pedrosa’s thoughtful, serious approach showcases the joys and opportunities, as well as the trauma, of displacement and marvellously balances aesthetic pleasure and politics.’ Yet opinion was far from unanimous: the works on show, The Art Newspaper thought, ‘measured by technical rather [than] representative properties, are, frankly, ropey’; Folha de S.Paulo complained that Pedrosa ‘reduced the artists to slogans’. Pedrosa’s interest in identity will be familiar to visitors of Museu de Arte de São Paulo, where he is director (with an extension into neighbouring premises opening in March), where he uses a different theme every year to programme. This year ‘LGBTQIA+ diversity stories’ encompassed solo shows of work by Francis Bacon, Catherine Opie and Leonilson.",

            "‘My interest is always to break down the distance between what we think [of] as art or high art and what we do in our daily life,’ Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] once told The Korea Herald. During his close-to-40-year engagement with what has been characterised as relational aesthetics, the Thai artist has become known for his participatory events, from cooking pad thai for gallery goers to providing them with ping-pong tables. You’d think it might be tricky to encapsulate such a career in a retrospective, but his MoMA PS1 survey, which closed in March, before moving to LUMA Arles in June, had a go, as did a second retrospective at Gropius Bau, Berlin, which opened in September, serving curry and Turkish coffees, and providing hangout spaces where the interactions are the work.\n\nGiven the social aspect of his practice, it is unsurprising that Tiravanija hasn’t hidden himself away in his studio: he has also established himself as a consummate curator. Building on his curating of the triennial Okayama Art Summit in 2022 and cocurating of the Thailand Biennale in 2023 [https://artreview.com/thailand-biennale-2023-the-open-world-chiang-rai-review/], he oversaw this year’s edition of Art Spectrum, a biennial exhibition featuring the next generation of Asian artists, including Heecheon Kim [https://artreview.com/heecheon-kim-keeping-it-real/], Riar Rizaldi [https://artreview.com/riar-rizaldis-theory-of-many-worlds/] and Vivien Zhang, which was held at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul. You might see the last, which was as diverse as it was intriguing, as an extension of the artist’s ongoing teaching activities (at Columbia University, New York) and his support of Gallery Ver, a commercial gallery space in his native Thailand. One thing’s for sure though, Tiravanija is as open and generous to other artists as he is to those who attend and at times become a part of his exhibitions; even if repetitive, it is effective, offering a form of openness that feels increasingly relevant to artists, given the fractious nature of our current times. Amidst everything else, Tiravanija also found time to contribute two new works to this year’s Forest Festival [https://artreview.com/10-exhibitions-to-see-in-september-2024/#:~:text=of%20Arata%20Isozaki-,Forest%20Festival%20of%20the%20Arts%20Okayama,-Various%20venues%2C%20Okayama] in Okayama (which included a series of textile works and ceramic bowls, offering visitors a lunchbox filled with locally sourced ingredients), an exhibition in Montreal, where he hosted a rehearsal space for local bands, as well as a roomsize installation at Pilar Corrias in London, just in time for Frieze Week.",

And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

As the former member of the Italian Communist Party told Vogue this year, family takes up another third, while the rest of her time is devoted to ‘culture and the Fondazione’. The Venice-and-Milan-based private institution is no trinket (with Tokyo and Shanghai project spaces), and Prada is very hands-on, telling Vogue how she struggled to find a curator who would fully embrace her vision of a future show on feminism. She did, however, get the likes of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler to curate Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Technology and Power, 1500–2025, a Marx-tinged show on tech and power that closed in January; while Meriem Bennani installed a solo exhibition in Milan, Christoph Büchel [https://artreview.com/christoph-buchel-monte-di-pieta-fondazione-prada-venice-biennale/] in Venice, Michaël Borremans in China and Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin in Japan.",

            "How do you extend your influence beyond one private foundation? Take charge of two. Last year Sandretto Re Rebaudengo was named president of Fondazione Arte CRT, which supplies loans and new work to the Turin Civic Gallery (GAM) and Castello di Rivoli, as well as site-specific commissions for OGR Torino, and has since doubled the foundation’s annual acquisitions budget to €1m. The patron, whose Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo has amassed a collection of more than 1,500 artworks, has long had exhibition spaces in Turin and neighbouring Guarene, but in recent years she’s been expanding her reach: she’s turning a Venetian island into an art centre (set to open next year), and the Madrid wing of the Fondazione is now homing in on a permanent HQ. Sandretto also sits on committees at New York’s MoMA, New Museum and CCS Bard, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, London’s Tate Modern, Shanghai’s Rockbund Art Museum and Barcelona’s Fundación MACBA, among others. At her eponymous Turin foundation meanwhile, she gave solo shows to The Otolith Group, Stefanie Heinze and Bekhbaatar Enkhtur.",

Three months later, a partnership deal was announced between NGS, where 70 percent of the collection is dedicated to Singaporean artists and 30 percent to Southeast Asian artists, and the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts to encourage loans, research partnerships and residency programmes. The 2024 exhibitions programme at NGS featured a retrospective of Kim Lim and shows for Cheong Soo Pieng, pioneer of the Nanyang art style, and centenarian Lim Tze Peng, Singapore’s oldest living and active artist.

            "During CDMX art week this February, the couple behind Kurimanzutto gallery saw their artists exhibiting or performing at five renowned institutions in Mexico City, including Museo Jumex and Museo Tamayo, while Gabriel Orozco, whom Kuri first met when the gallerist was aged eleven, staged an exhibition at Kurimanzutto’s cavernous San Miguel Chapultepec address. It is not just the high profile at home that marks out the gallery, but the global network that its geographically-diverse artist roster has firmly infiltrated. Wilfredo Prieto represented Cuba at the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/], while WangShui, Bárbara Sánchez-Kane [https://artreview.com/barbara-sanchez-kane-new-lexicons-for-embodiment-kurimanzutto-new-york-review/] and Ana Segovia were in the main show; Haegue Yang [https://artreview.com/artist/haegue-yang/] showed in London and Chicago; Minerva Cuevas exhibited at CC Foundation, Shanghai; and the gallery worked with peers Shibunkaku for a presentation at Art Collaborations Kyoto. Kurimanzutto’s satellite space in New York gives them clout there, too: this year, the Met installed specially commissioned architectural interventions by Nairy Baghramian and Petrit Halilaj, and in February the gallery announced the representation of the estate of the late New York icon John Giorno.",

He celebrated – how else? – with a show of Beuys’s works on paper at his London gallery at the start of the year, and another at Ropac’s Seoul branch at the end of the year. Having opened in Salzburg in 1983, and adding two London and two Paris spaces along the way, Ropac landed in South Korea in 2021 and this year doubled the square meterage there by adding another floor, allowing for a simultaneous exhibition of Donald Judd’s sculptures and paintings in September. As well as some of the great American estates, Ropac has become the de facto rep for canonical artists of the German-speaking world, among them VALIE EXPORT, Anselm Kiefer, Not Vital and Imi Knoebel. Georg Baselitz turned eighty-five this year, so there were more celebrations to arrange, with shows staged by the painter at nine institutions around the world, including at London’s Serpentine galleries and Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich.",

The artist had removed her work from Documenta in 2022 [https://artreview.com/hito-steyerl-says-she-has-no-faith-in-documenta-tackling-antisemitism/] due to what she perceived as inaction by its curators over antisemitism, and was scathing of many of her peers who had publicly criticised Israel, telling The Guardian that many were merely practising ‘art as social media performance’. Furthermore, she bemoaned that it was those who only condemn violence on one side ‘that dominate the debate’. Steyerl’s engagement with the conflict comes as no surprise: questions of power, violence and mediation have been her subject matter for two decades now, parlayed into her video essays and multimedia installations. This year she premiered three new works that take the Nord Stream oil pipeline system as their subject at the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, and settled into her new role as professor in Emergent Digital Media at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

            "Artist, curator, institutional director – Al Qasimi can claim to belong to nearly every constituent sector of the artworld (albeit these days she’s not really that well known for her painting). Plus, in the real world, she’s royalty. And yet, in recent years she has leveraged her expertise and knowledge of art from the Gulf region and further afield, to operate in geographies beyond the Emirate and areas in which she can absolutely rely on royal privilege. An exhibition of paintings she curated by the senior Māori artist Emily Karaka, which opened this autumn at the Sharjah Art Foundation, of which she is also president and founding director, may be indicative of the direction planned for the 2026 Biennale of Sydney [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-lead-the-2026-biennale-of-sydney/]. Al Qasimi was this year appointed curator of the Australian survey, which she will work on while developing her plans for the 2025 Aichi Triennale [https://artreview.com/hoor-al-qasimi-to-direct-aichi-triennale-2025/] in Japan, of which she is artistic director (the first non-Japanese person to occupy the position, although she speaks the language, having studied there). Having previously curated the Lahore Biennale (in 2020) and the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Al Qasimi is in demand, and her global presence is reflected in her home institution’s programming, which, in addition to Karaka, has featured survey exhibitions of South African multimedia icon William Kentridge, Brazilian painter Antonio Dias and Pakistani artist and Women’s Action Forum cofounder Lala Rukh, not to mention the annual March Meeting [https://artreview.com/the-top-10-exhibitions-to-see-in-march-2024/#:~:text=March%20Meeting%202024%3A%20Tawashujat] conference. Next February marks the opening of the 16th Sharjah Biennial [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-title-approach-and-participants/] (Al Qasimi curated the 2023 edition [https://artreview.com/artists-for-2023-sharjah-biennial-revealed/], developing a programme initiated by the late Okwui Enwezor, having been involved with the event – as director – since 2003, when she cocurated the sixth edition). For this edition, Al Qasimi has appointed an all-female team of curators [https://artreview.com/sharjah-biennial-16-announces-curatorial-framework-and-initial-list-of-artists/] that includes many of the leading lights among curators operating in the context of the global majority, including Sri Lanka’s Natasha Ginwala [https://artreview.com/artist/natasha-ginwala/], Indonesian curator Alia Swastika [https://artreview.com/artist/alia-swastika/?year=2024], Bahraini-Singaporean artist Amal Khalaf, New Zealand artist Megan Tamati-Quennell and Turkish curator Zeynep Öz. Moreover, in the context of an artworld in which cancellations and boycotts are rife – coming from every direction – and generating a consequent culture of fear, Al Qasimi remains one of the few voices still prepared to use the platform art (and royal privilege) affords them in order to express their opinions directly and to keep discussions that most people allow to fade away firmly in the spotlight, whether they concern the current carnage in Palestine and Lebanon or those suffering from other conflicts across the globe. Beyond all that, Al Qasimi also serves as president of the International Biennale Association, president of the hugely influential Africa Institute in Sharjah and on the board of Ashkal Alwan in Beirut. She is also on the advisory boards of the Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi and Darat al Funun in Amman. Beyond her involvement with art, she also founded the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, and earlier this year presented a clothing collection in London which was developed from the work of her late brother, who worked in the fashion industry. But beyond her personal achievements, Al Qasimi is also a symbol of the increasing influence of the Gulf region in the spheres of finance, commerce, politics, sports and entertainment, and, of course (but perhaps primarily by virtue of the first two elements on this list) art.",

            "Gates is an artist who knows as much about the intricacies of planning law as he does about the inside of a studio. His sculpture was the focal point of a survey that opened in May at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, materially derived from dilapidated architecture and the urban realm, and specifically informed by Freedmen’s Town in Houston’s Fourth Ward. With regards to the latter, Gates is advising an initiative that plans to preserve this historic neighbourhood built and shaped by Black people following emancipation: an endeavour that’s in the mould of the socially engaged mini-empire he has been building on the South Side of Chicago since 2006. Over in Tokyo, the artist’s Afro-Mingei exhibition at the Mori Art Museum, which imagined ‘the artistic possibilities of combining Black aesthetics and Japanese craft philosophies to envision hybrid-culture futures’, laid the groundwork for incense and sake collaborations with small family-owned businesses in Japan. This mix of commerce and creativity made him an obvious choice for Prada’s diversity council, where Gates has spearheaded a mentorship programme for designers of colour.",

            "Following on from several years of more hard-hitting, London-focused film projects – including the 2020 Small Axe series of five films that charted the lives of West Indian immigrants to the city, codirecting the documentary Uprising (2021) on a 1981 fire in South London, and his filmic monument Grenfell [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-will-not-look-away-serpentine-gallery-london/] (2023), a single-shot circling of the site of the tragic 2017 apartment block fire – the gap between McQueen’s art and cinema projects feels wider of late. This year, McQueen received a solo exhibition that continues to occupy both Dia sites in New York, with several film works and a new photographic series on display in the institution’s Chelsea space, and in a massive former factory site Beacon is his new installation Bass, the basement space filled only with coloured lighting and reverberating with snatches of music (The music an extended jam session, recorded in-situ, between different forms of the titular instrument, played by a stellar ensemble that included Meshell Ndegeochello and jazz veteran Marcus Miller.) The show received widespread acclaim, and will travel to Switzerland’s Schaulager next year. He also released the documentary Occupied City [https://artreview.com/steve-mcqueen-occupied-city-review/], in which he slowly traced and filmed all the locations that appear in author, historian and producer (and McQueen’s wife) Bianca Stigter’s book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940–1945 (2019). Offering a meditative study of the Dutch capital under the Nazis, it was a cinematic tour de force that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.\n\nSo far, so auteur. McQueen’s second celluloid outing this year, Blitz, however, which opened to mixed reviews, demonstrated how mainstream he can go. Telling the story of a young boy during the World War II bombing of London, it was ‘an old-fashioned children’s adventure movie, a rollicking yarn that might have been on television on a Bank Holiday afternoon’, thought the BBC. ‘Shockingly conventional’, Variety noted. But McQueen seems confident straddling both documentary and fiction forms, as well as arthouse and (attempted) blockbuster modes, and continues to serve as a model to artists who might want to make work that can occupy the gallery, the cinema, as well as home streaming platforms.",

Programming this past year was reflective of their commitment to conceptual work by women and tracing artistic lineages across generations: the legacy of cult artists from the Pictures Generation, which the gallery started representing in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger (whose showing at the London space coincided with the Serpentine stop of a major touring retrospective) and new-media pioneer Gretchen Bender (presented in LA), was echoed in the work of millennial artist Nora Turato (shown in LA [https://artreview.com/nora-turato-not-your-usual-self-spruth-magers-berlin-review/]) and Cao Fei [https://artreview.com/artist/cao-fei/] (who had major institutional shows in Munich, Savannah and Shanghai). In May the gallery snapped up Mire Lee [https://artreview.com/the-uncontainable-mire-lee-interview-emily-mcdermott-hyundai-commission-tate-modern-turbine-hall/] ahead of the opening of her haunting Tate Turbine Hall commission.",

Serve the Dominant Ideology or Stop Being a Pussy, Frances Stark’s first exhibition with the gallery since her old home, Gavin Brown’s enterprise, folded into Gladstone in 2020, opened in June and featured 12 paintings of open books. Another astute commentator on the artworld, artist David Salle, and the lucrative estate of Robert Rauschenberg also joined the gallery’s roster this year. With locations in New York, Brussels and Seoul [https://artreview.com/gladstone-gallery-to-open-new-seoul-space/], and artists ranging from Matthew Barney [https://artreview.com/matthew-barney-secondary-no-pain-no-gain/] to Marisa Merz and Rachel Rose (all of whom had shows), as well as the likes of Rirkrit Tiravanija [https://artreview.com/rirkrit-tiravanija-blow-up-the-museum-a-lot-of-people-moma-ps1-new-york/] and Sarah Lucas (who have had significant shows elsewhere this year), Gladstone has colossal spread.

            "A decade since its conception and three years after opening, Hoffmann’s 11-hectare, eight-venue art campus LUMA Arles continues both to wow first-time visitors and to impress with its restless, conscious exhibition programming and food culture. This year saw solo presentations for William Kentridge and Erika Verzutti, and a postapocalyptic, robot-centric show by Diana Thater. During the annual photography festival Les Rencontres d’Arles, LUMA was also the backdrop for a collaborative exhibition between Lee Friedlander and Joel Cohen, in which the filmmaker cast a subjective glance on the photographer’s work while acknowledging its influence on his own films. Meanwhile, the billionaire philanthropist continued her usual commitments: presiding over the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles and Swiss Institute in New York, and sitting on the boards of the New Museum, Tate and the Serpentine Galleries. But this year, Hoffmann – who studied film – also became the president of the ailing Locarno Film Festival in order, she told the press, to ‘give something back’ to Switzerland, while admitting she hadn’t attended the festival in the past 27 years.",

            "This year has been business as usual for the founder of White Cube, who focused on consolidating a growing empire following the opening of two new spaces, in Seoul and New York, last year (joining ones in London, Hong Kong and Paris). Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

His tenure has seen the museum’s endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‘I have not had a good night’s sleep in pretty close to 25 years,’ he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board’s connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. “It’s the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,” Lowry told CNN. “I didn’t want to be the person who stayed too long.”",

Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution’s long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‘Superbrain’ Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn’t just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‘Now AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists’, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‘focused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy’. Meanwhile, the curator’s calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

            "For the past few years the press has been speculating on seventy-nine-year-old Larry Gagosian’s succession plans for what is regularly estimated as a business with a $1 billion annual turnover (accumulated through the sale of works by the likes of Nan Goldin [https://artreview.com/artist/nan-goldin/], Carol Bove and Richard Prince [https://artreview.com/richard-prince-clearview-ai-and-your-face-gagosian/], who each had a show this year in at least one of Gagosian’s 19 galleries around the world). There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
