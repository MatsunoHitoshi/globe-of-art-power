Although OMA are currently working on a series of large-scale projects such as the CCTV building in China, it‚Äôs no surprise that Koolhaas‚Äôs major impact on the art world is as a thinker rather than a doer: his analysis of contemporary museum culture featured in last year‚Äôs Venice Biennale, while this year, having designed its summer pavilion, he co-curated a 24-hour lecture marathon at London‚Äôs Serpentine Gallery.",

In what has become an exemplary career marked by the lucid prose of his catalogue essays ‚Äì something all too rarely encountered these days ‚Äì and the discriminating and sympathetic eye with which he puts together exhibitions, he has consistently raised the bar high, and then vaulted over it. From MoMA, he went on to curate the SITE Santa Fe Biennial and become a professor of art at New York University. One might call him the leading intellectual of contemporary art ‚Äì our answer to Bernard Berenson. This year, however, he has surpassed even his own high-water mark. Named Dean of the Yale School of Art, in 2007 he will also become the first American ever to hold the post of Director of the Venice Biennale.",

Frustrated with aspects of MoMA‚Äôs institutional culture, he made the leap to chief curator at LA‚Äôs renowned Hammer. His professed reason for leaving an important post in New York‚Äôs most important institution is the vibrant energy in the LA scene, and at the Hammer particularly. It‚Äôs a move seen by many as another confirmation of the migration of America‚Äôs creative centre from the East to the West. And though he‚Äôs kept fairly quiet, especially compared to the Hammer‚Äôs glamorous director, Ann Philbin, his initial steps show promise: Garrels helped steer a show of drawings by the Latvian-born American artist Vija Celmins, in association with the Pompidou Centre; his first clear announcement of his take has been this summer‚Äôs Eden‚Äôs Edge: Fifteen LA Artists, an idiosyncratic show ranging from established figures like Lari Pittman and Jim Shaw to relative unknowns; and his enthusiasm for LA‚Äôs young scene, and the Hammer‚Äôs ability to work on small shows with emerging artists, looks set to make waves. What comes next for Garrels is one of the most intriguing questions of a Southern California scene that continues to expand and deepen.",

Following a popular retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, he designed the fireworks for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics (for which he was director of visual and special effects), including the infamous Footprints of History, which were broadcast to the world as if live in the form of a CGI montage. Guo-Qiang argues that this is of no consequence, as the fireworks are, in fact, two artworks ‚Äì the one experienced as an ephemeral live event and the ‚Äòconcept‚Äô experienced with the aid of CGI.

It‚Äôs also an image supported by its very visible owner, Simon de Pury, former chairman of Sotheby‚Äôs Europe, who recently produced a compilation album, Saturday@Phillips, and brought the splashy Hip Hop‚Äôs Crown Jewels to his salerooms. His standing as an auctioneer was further underlined this summer when he was the focus of artist Julius Friedman‚Äôs film project Make It Rain, screened at Patrick Painter in LA, which pointed to de Pury as a rainmaker extraordinaire.

            "Philippe de Montebello‚Äôs announcement, in January, that he would retire from his Metropolitan Museum directorship by year‚Äôs end, set critical tongues wagging about potential replacements. At the top of most shortlists was MoMA‚Äôs Glenn D. Lowry, whose subsequent appointment of ex-Walker Art Center Director Kathy Halbreich as Associate Director ‚Äì a specially created position ‚Äì seemed to signal her as the chief ‚Äôs heir apparent (Halbreich last appeared on the Power 100 list in 2004, during the Walker‚Äôs $73.8 million Herzog & de Meuron-designed expansion). As it turns out, the MoMA board approved a new five-year contract with Lowry in February, a promising turn for a museum currently undergoing one of the most significant in-house shakeups in its 79-year history.\n\nFollowing the museum‚Äôs rule that staff step down at the age of sixty-five, John Elderfield this past summer turned his post as Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture over to Ann Temkin, continuing work on the museum‚Äôs forthcoming Matisse and de Kooning shows as Chief Curator Emeritus of Painting and Sculpture. And now that MoMA has assumed full managerial command of P.S.1, as stipulated in the terms of their 2000 merger, P.S.1 Director Alanna Heiss is slated to retire at the end of the year. Chief Curator at Large Kynaston McShine will also make his exit in the near future.\n\nWhile Lowry remains MoMA‚Äôs money man, these circumstances leave considerable room for Halbreich to inject the institution with a much-needed dose of curatorial relevance ‚Äì and as an agent of change, she replaces Lowry on this list. In her 16 years at the Walker, Halbreich excelled in many facets of her directorial role, mounting significant exhibitions of Bruce Nauman, Joseph Beuys, Chantal Akerman and H√©lio Oiticica; elevating the museum‚Äôs performing and media arts sectors into departments proper; spearheading the museum‚Äôs expansion; and leading a successful $100m capital campaign.\n\nHalbreich‚Äôs associate directorship, which she assumed this past February, comes with no requirements for fundraising or capital expansion, though her responsibilities do include developing MoMA‚Äôs contemporary acquisitions, through the Fund for the 21st Century, and focusing the museum‚Äôs ‚Äòpan-institutional contemporary programs and initiatives‚Äô. Given the museum‚Äôs sedentary reliance upon a conservative, male-centric account of modern art, expectations are high that Halbreich, Temkin and the other young hires stocking the museum‚Äôs departments will make the collection relevant to a twenty-first century audience. If How Latitudes Become Forms: Art in a Global Age, Halbreich‚Äôs 2003 Walker exhibition, is any indication, relevance is forthcoming. A four-year collaboration between curators and educators from the Walker and China, India, Brazil and South Africa resulted in a year-long series of programmes, performing arts commissions and a high school teaching curriculum. Here‚Äôs hoping that the Modern sees equal returns on Halbreich‚Äôs progressive approach.",

Throughout this crisis, MOCA‚Äôs world-beating exhibitions, including Martin Kippenberger and Marlene Dumas retrospectives, WACK! and ¬© MURAKAMI, were touring the globe. Now breathing a little again, MOCA and Chief Curator Paul Schimmel will be focusing on home turf, with the hugely ambitious exhibition Wasteland: Art After Earth Art (including a mega-installation in the Mojave Desert by Christoph B√ºchel ‚Äì yikes), a Jack Goldstein retrospective and a bold reappraisal of 1970s California art.",

While his relaunched Saatchi Gallery has been cranking out voluminous attention-grabbing shows from the collection, the former ad man has found time to author an art-school realityshow contest, knock out a second book of quitefunny answers to interview questions and once more ruffle the official art establishment‚Äôs feathers, this time with an offer to donate his collection to the nation. In July, Saatchi announced plans to turn his gallery into ‚ÄòMoCA London‚Äô, gifting ¬£25m of work to the UK, but the Arts Council has reportedly baulked at the condition that the gallery be able to sell from the collection to fund acquisitions. As we await the next chapter, Saatchi is still, entertainingly, throwing his weight around.",

Many hopes are pinned on such regional branches, and the distinctive building ‚Äì notably near the German border, designed by Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines, with a roof resembling a fallen net ‚Äì is meant to beckon tourists on looks alone. It duly attracted 100,000 visitors in the first four days it was open. As well as an ongoing scheme to use vacant space at the Palais de Tokyo to show work by midcareer artists, Pacquement has announced plans for a ‚Äòpop-up‚Äô mobile Pompidou centre that will further the brand‚Äôs expansion. Oh, yes, and bring more art to the people. When it comes to world domination, it seems funding (currently holding up Pompidou Mobile) is the only thing standing in Pacquement‚Äôs way.

The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer ‚Äì False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober ‚Äì all owned by Joannou.¬†",

Esche is also both an adviser to the Rijksakademie, Amsterdam, and a director of London publishing house Afterall. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs important that we constantly stretch the definition of what ‚Äúmaking art public‚Äù means in terms of exhibitions,‚Äô Esche told ArtReview last year, and the programme at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, which he has directed since 2004, reflects this: a new three-year exhibition titled The Way Beyond Art showcases some of the socially engaged and expanded practices that Esche champions, like Chto Delat and Can Altay. The Van Abbe also supports archival research and revision under its ‚ÄòDeviant Practice‚Äô grants. Esche remains dedicated to exploring the limits of the contemporary museum.¬†",

Last year he bemoaned that ‚Äòhaving a network‚Äô was being confused with being a good curator (something which will be tested by his curating of a James Ensor show at the Royal Academy, London, this month). This year he told the Brooklyn Rail that ‚Äòa good painting is a bad painting in a photograph‚Äô, a broadside perhaps to the kind of abstraction that is being traded over Instagram. He played on the relationship between the canvas and the lens further with a series of works debuted at Zeno X in September, a show marking 25 years of working with the Antwerp gallery. Insert I, II, III and IV are paintings of iPhone photographs of his own works that Tuymans shot during a 2013 solo show at the Menil Collection, Houston. Lenses of a different kind were a subject of his exhibitions at the Museum aan de Stroom (a homecoming gig) and currently at the National Portrait Gallery, London, featuring as their motif only his works that include spectacles. ¬†",

            "This year Sharp and Slotover have taken a step back from running the fairs they founded in London (that‚Äôll be Frieze London and Frieze Masters, the latter the duo‚Äôs venture into not-so-contemporary art) and New York. Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes.¬†\n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there‚Äôs Slotover‚Äôs influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city‚Äôs East End.",

And that‚Äôs because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We‚Äôre essentially trying to exchange one for the other.‚Äô To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration ‚Äì something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

This last retrospective not only found Hirst partying with Albert II, the principality‚Äôs crown prince; it also included spot, spin and butterfly paintings, all series which, he announced at the Gagosian show (entitled End of an Era), he would no longer be producing.\n\nThis may to some extent slow the shrinking of Hirst‚Äôs market ‚Äì down by 93 percent last year and bound to be lower this annum ‚Äì and allay the artist‚Äôs detractors, who in August reiterated and expanded on accusations of plagiarism. A charge Hirst branded ‚Äògibberish‚Äô. Still, Hirst isn‚Äôt one for cooling his heels. His Murderme art collection grows apace, his Other Criteria publishing wing and retail outlets continue to turn out books, sell multiples and support exhibitions ‚Äì and he‚Äôs rumoured to have a longterm gig booked in: a Tate retrospective to coincide with London‚Äôs 2012 Olympics.¬†",

Broad (together with wife Edythe) wants to be the art angel in the City of Angels, creating press and fanfare whenever he gives. And give he undeniably does.\n\nThere are fears being voiced from LA‚Äôs art community that Broad is having a significant homogenising influence on the city‚Äôs museums. Press coverage of Broad is filled with sideswipes and barely concealed irritation on the part of patrons, curators and museum directors (except those he supports or those waiting for a cheque).\n\nThe truth is, however, that museums need Broad like never before: California has a 12 percent unemployment rate and a $20b deficit, and financial cuts are being made left, right and centre. Broad, with a fortune valued at $5.7b, has pledged to give 75 percent of it away. And the building of the Broad collection museum on Grand Avenue, designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which is now getting under way in earnest, should keep him busy for the time being.",

In the absence of a replacement being named, chief curator Julieta Gonz√°lez continues to serve as interim director. It was perhaps an odd move too for a Mexican institution to take on a Guggenheim-curated touring show on Latin American art (Pablo Le√≥n de la Barra‚Äôs Under the Same Sun), and the homegrown The Natural Order of Things received mixed reviews. Hosting solo shows for Jose D√°vila and Walid Raad points to a welcome direction, however, for the man who remains one of Latin America‚Äôs most important collectors.¬†",

For to be the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art involves a lot of fundraising and a head for figures. These are likely prefixed by dollar signs and suffixed by ‚Äòmillion‚Äô: the $650m needed to complete LACMA‚Äôs teardown-and-rebuild capital project; the $117.5m Govan secured from LA County in April. Or they might refer to missing square metres, after it emerged that Peter Zumthor‚Äôs design will include 10 percent less area than the planned 36,000sqm. Or be attached to the deal with Budi Tek‚Äôs Yuz Museum, with which LACMA will partner on a jointly owned foundation managing 90 percent of the Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur‚Äôs collection. Govan knows that making art accessible in California requires an unholy alliance of number crunching and celebrity: hence roping in Kanye West to donate $10m to James Turrell‚Äôs decades-awaited Roden Crater.",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles‚Äôs gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles‚Äôs ability to keep di¬¢erent bases covered.",

King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‚ÄòArtists‚Ä¶ like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.‚Äô His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who‚Äôs who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks‚Äôs skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive.¬†",

This last year, weapon-mangling Pedro Reyes and claymation heroes Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg have also been welcomed into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile Lisson‚Äôs senior artists continue to assert themselves on a global scale ‚Äì Ai Weiwei and Anish Kapoor have had significant international exhibitions and Marina Abramoviƒá has been, well, everywhere. After opening its first international space in Milan two years ago, Lisson recently set up a by-appointment office in New York: rumour has it that a full stateside gallery is soon to follow.",

This last was Robert Colescott, whose paintings, which Blum & Poe hung at their Los Angeles gallery in March, combined surrealism with satire to comment on the state of race politics. Also joining the gallery was young West Coaster Mimi Lauter, who had a show in May, Chicago-based Tony Lewis, Brazilian Solange Pessoa and Japan‚Äôs Tomoo Gokita. The gallery has had a presence in Gokita‚Äôs hometown of Tokyo since 2014, and it was there, in June, that it showed Agn√®s Varda. The New Wave filmmaker is undergoing something of a renaissance (and, in collaborations with JR, being embraced by the artworld). That the boys are championing an older artist proves something of a theme: they also gave octogenarian sculptor Wendell Dayton his first major solo show.",

            "This year has been business as usual for the founder of White Cube, who focused on consolidating a growing empire following the opening of two new spaces, in Seoul and New York, last year (joining ones in London, Hong Kong and Paris). Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards ‚Äì citing ‚Äòa general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management‚Äô. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate‚Äôs more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ram√≠rez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille‚Äôs MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie‚Äôs ‚Äì which Pinault owns ‚Äì hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple‚Äôs Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

At the end of 2018, the forthcoming Whitney Biennial ‚Äì at the museum he‚Äôs directed since 2003 ‚Äì became a flashpoint for controversy when employees demanded the removal of board member Warren B. Kanders over his involvement with teargas manufacturer Safariland. This after the 2017 biennial had been embroiled in a war of words over its inclusion of a painting accused of sensationalising racist violence. This time around, Weinberg dithered, artists quit the biennial and Kanders eventually resigned. One sensed damage-control when, in September, the institution broke ground on David Hammons‚Äôs monumental public project Day‚Äôs End and Weinberg described the installation as representing ‚Äòour commitment to community and civic good‚Äô. Meanwhile, the Whitney continued to settle into its downtown home, with a big Warhol retrospective and an emphasis on shows for artists of colour (Pope.L, Kevin Beasley, Derek Fordjour). How much reputational damage the biennial hullabaloo has caused in the long term remains to be seen.",

For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter‚Äôs subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‚Äòsignature‚Äô aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‚Äòcult of personality‚Äô he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a frightening development,‚Äô he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales ‚Äì Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m ‚Äì it‚Äôs been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman‚Äôs New York space in May).

She‚Äôs made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she‚Äôs not seeking a foothold in Asia, she‚Äôs developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo‚Äôs ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

His tenure has seen the museum‚Äôs endowment increase to $1.7b, he has embarked on extensions that have doubled the exhibition spaces (the final stages of its $400m expansion and renovation led to a four-month closure of the institution this summer) and, in 2000, he brought PS1 into the MoMA stable. ‚ÄòI have not had a good night‚Äôs sleep in pretty close to 25 years,‚Äô he joked. There remains an operation budget shortfall of $110m a year, and commercial revenues from retail and restaurants are stagnant. Lowry has also had to weather protests this year on the board‚Äôs connections to the fossil fuel industry and staff unrest over its silence on the Israel-Hamas war. Kicking off retirement, Lowry will embark on a lecture series at the Louvre in Paris, with an eye to publishing a book. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the right moment to think about the future of the museum and I just thought, carpe diem,‚Äù Lowry told CNN. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be the person who stayed too long.‚Äù",

            "It has been a turbulent 12 months since the head of the four Tate galleries took the number one spot on this list. While discontent and protest Ô¨Åtfully surfaced from the activist-left over BP‚Äôs corporate sponsorship, in the spring it was Serota‚Äôs detractors on the right who made the most noise. The conservative press gleefully stretched for Oscar Wilde clich√©s when Tate lost not one but two directors in quick succession. Was it carelessness on Serota‚Äôs part? Perhaps not, but Penelope Curtis leaving Tate Britain for Calouste Gulbenkian Museum after a much maligned Ô¨Åve-year tenure, and Chris Dercon announcing his decision to jump ship from Tate Modern to direct Berlin‚Äôs Volksb√ºhne (although he‚Äôll be staying in the post until next summer) was not a good look for Serota.¬†\n\nThe ten-storey extension, which dwarfs Tate Modern‚Äôs original building like a super cruiseliner on the Venetian skyline, is proving controversial too. Currently four years behind its original opening date ‚Äì during which performance spaces in the power station‚Äôs old oil tanks, opened to much hype in 2012, have sat idle as construction continues above them ‚Äì the additional space is still missing ¬£30m of funding, although Serota says he is conÔ¨Ådent this will be found before the new launch date of June 2016. Last year‚Äôs top spot came in recognition of Tate‚Äôs vast international network of global acquisitions committees and internationally active curatorial teams. No change there. Nor has all the construction dented its exhibition programme (Tanks aside) and general popularity with punters: a(nother) record ‚Äì 7.9 million visits across all four sites in 2014‚Äì15, with 5.7 million alone stepping into Tate Modern. But with his legacy projects nearing completion, is the sixty-nine-year-old eyeing retirement in some pleasant corner of Southern England?. ¬†",

Each commission or exhibition that had been programmed, the curator claimed, would feed into the institution‚Äôs long-term curatorial strategy. Among those artists whose work ‚ÄòSuperbrain‚Äô Obrist had harvested was Refik Anadol [https://artreview.com/artist/refik-anadol/] (with an exhibition that incorporated visual data of coral reefs and rainforests) and Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst [https://artreview.com/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-ghosts-of-machine-learning-serpentine-artificial-intelligence/] (who presented an AI-abetted choral installation). This wasn‚Äôt just about programming, though, Obrist later insisted to Art News: it was about working out a blueprint for survival. ‚ÄòNow AI is raising huge challenges for the economy of artists‚Äô, he stated, adding that the Serpentine shows were ‚Äòfocused on strategies for artists to assert their agency in a creative economy‚Äô. Meanwhile, the curator‚Äôs calendar of talks, panel appearances and book releases continued at the usual frenetic pace. Of the latter, new volumes of his conversations with Christo, Gustav Metzger and Norman Foster were published.",

            "For the past few years the press has been speculating on seventy-nine-year-old Larry Gagosian‚Äôs succession plans for what is regularly estimated as a business with a $1 billion annual turnover (accumulated through the sale of works by the likes of Nan Goldin [https://artreview.com/artist/nan-goldin/], Carol Bove and Richard Prince [https://artreview.com/richard-prince-clearview-ai-and-your-face-gagosian/], who each had a show this year in at least one of Gagosian‚Äôs 19 galleries around the world). There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‚ÄòIs that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.‚Äô But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian‚Äôs invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner‚Äôs eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery‚Äôs youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it‚Äôs a move that is indicative of Zwirner‚Äôs long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
