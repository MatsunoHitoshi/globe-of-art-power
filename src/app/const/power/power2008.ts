            "And the first shall be last (although the management would like to point out that everyone on this list – and, for that matter, not on this list – is a winner). Thomas Kinkade, Painter of Light™, is the original contemporary art brand. Kinkade is the most collected living artist (a few years ago it was estimated that one in 20 American homes owned a work by the master), bringing art to the people in a way Damien Hirst can only dream of. Where Hirst has Sotheby’s, Kinkade has QVC. The American’s works come in various degrees of finish, from standard and textured prints, to prints hand-highlighted by a team of ‘master craftsmen’, to 100 percent original Kinkades. And while Kinkade’s religious inspiration may make him seem distanced from a traditional artist-as-bad-boy image, he’s not averse to a bit of ‘ritual territory marking’ (including, allegedly, urinating over Winnie the Pooh at Disneyland). What’s the luminous one been up to recently? Well, following hot on the heels of NASCAR® Thunder! and Country Living comes his newest release, Snow White Discovers the Cottage (all works 2008). Oh yeah, and 11 November sees the release (albeit straight to DVD) of the first-ever Thomas Kinkade movie (Thomas Kinkade’s Christmas Cottage). Suck on that, Mr Hirst.",

            "‘If we don’t take immediate measures, the building will collapse: There are pieces of metal falling off of it every day,’ the president of Centre Pompidou told The New York Times ahead of the Paris museum’s closure [https://artreview.com/workers-at-centre-pompidou-strike-ahead-of-2025-renovations/] for a five-year, €262m refurbishment in 2025. The French government will cover the cost of this technical work, but Le Bon needs to find a further €207m from sponsors. Le Bon and his predecessor’s primary strategy has been an aggressive franchise model, in which international cities pay to use the Pompidou name for five years (renewable) and have access to its 120,000-strong collection and expertise: Málaga took up the offer in 2015 (its ten-year contract was renewed this year), and Shanghai followed in 2019 (secured through 2028), while Brussels and Seoul outposts are due to open next year [https://artreview.com/centre-pompidou-to-open-contemporary-art-museum-in-saudi-arabia/]. The future of Pompidou New Jersey remains up in the air, however: the US state previously pulled out of the deal, but a new funding plan has put it back on the table – for now. While closed for renovation, Centre Pompidou plans to disperse its collection and expertise across France’s network of museums.",

There was however a burgeoning digital art scene making sense of the internet explosion and increasingly accessible computing power. Reas, a student of digital art pioneer John Maeda while he was at MIT, now professor at UCLA, has for two decades explored the juncture of visual art and technology, cofounding the open-source visual design software Processing in 2001. But with the advent of blockchain databases and the NFT explosion, Reas saw the need for a critical and informed platform for the most interesting digital art being made for NFT, which could also support artists financially. The website Feral File, launched in 2020, has become an important showcase for the broad church of net and digital art, with curated exhibitions of work by artists including Zach Blas, Orlan, LaTurbo Avedon and the AI entity Botto – all for sale as NFTs, of course.",

It is this mix of the sleek and down-home that makes his work such a hot ticket for high-profile collectors, who include François Pinault, Dakis Joannou and Charles Saatchi. Indeed, the value of his works sold at auction has risen from $23,000 (in May 2005) to just under $1.5 million (in June 2008), and as a measure of his success, he and wife Bharti Kher were recently signed to premier gallery Hauser & Wirth.",

Guo-Qiang argues that this is of no consequence, as the fireworks are, in fact, two artworks – the one experienced as an ephemeral live event and the ‘concept’ experienced with the aid of CGI.

Of course, Roman was pretty famous already, as the owner of Chelsea Football Club. Of late he’s backed exhibitions in London and Moscow (the inaugural show of girlfriend Dasha Zhukova’s new art centre, CCC). And the couple raised temperatures in Art Basel this summer: Roman bought a Giacometti and is rumoured to be moving into contemporary art – thus the presence and meaty ranking on this list.",

Balancing the mass appeal, his StudioFilmClub in the Caribbean, posters for which were included in his retrospective, has something of a cult status, too.

Such is the eighty-year-old’s status, he already has his own gallery in the Menil collection in Houston. Meanwhile, over in London this June, Twombly’s show at Tate Modern opened to widespread critical acclaim and introduced a new audience to one of America’s great artists, of whom Roland Barthes once wrote, ‘There is quite often in a single painter a whole history of painting.’",

With the acquisition of Art Chicago, the Toronto International Art Fair and the Armory Show in New York (which will be expanding this year into two simultaneous and adjacent fairs: Armory Contemporary and Armory Modern), Kennedy has turned Merchandise Mart into a major conduit of contemporary art commerce. This is no passing fancy, however; Kennedy started with MMPI in 1987, when he was fresh out of college, so we can assume that he sees something more in the contemporary art space than its rarefied flash.

Yet Phillips’s success continues to lie in its image as the more cutting-edge auction house, selling work by the likes of Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy. It’s also an image supported by its very visible owner, Simon de Pury, former chairman of Sotheby’s Europe, who recently produced a compilation album, Saturday@Phillips, and brought the splashy Hip Hop’s Crown Jewels to his salerooms. His standing as an auctioneer was further underlined this summer when he was the focus of artist Julius Friedman’s film project Make It Rain, screened at Patrick Painter in LA, which pointed to de Pury as a rainmaker extraordinaire. When you consider that the company has been running for just more than a decade and is the third most successful auction house in the world, Friedman’s choice of subject seems perfectly natural.",

            "Philippe de Montebello’s announcement, in January, that he would retire from his Metropolitan Museum directorship by year’s end, set critical tongues wagging about potential replacements. At the top of most shortlists was MoMA’s Glenn D. Lowry, whose subsequent appointment of ex-Walker Art Center Director Kathy Halbreich as Associate Director – a specially created position – seemed to signal her as the chief ’s heir apparent (Halbreich last appeared on the Power 100 list in 2004, during the Walker’s $73.8 million Herzog & de Meuron-designed expansion). As it turns out, the MoMA board approved a new five-year contract with Lowry in February, a promising turn for a museum currently undergoing one of the most significant in-house shakeups in its 79-year history.\n\nFollowing the museum’s rule that staff step down at the age of sixty-five, John Elderfield this past summer turned his post as Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture over to Ann Temkin, continuing work on the museum’s forthcoming Matisse and de Kooning shows as Chief Curator Emeritus of Painting and Sculpture. And now that MoMA has assumed full managerial command of P.S.1, as stipulated in the terms of their 2000 merger, P.S.1 Director Alanna Heiss is slated to retire at the end of the year. Chief Curator at Large Kynaston McShine will also make his exit in the near future.\n\nWhile Lowry remains MoMA’s money man, these circumstances leave considerable room for Halbreich to inject the institution with a much-needed dose of curatorial relevance – and as an agent of change, she replaces Lowry on this list. In her 16 years at the Walker, Halbreich excelled in many facets of her directorial role, mounting significant exhibitions of Bruce Nauman, Joseph Beuys, Chantal Akerman and Hélio Oiticica; elevating the museum’s performing and media arts sectors into departments proper; spearheading the museum’s expansion; and leading a successful $100m capital campaign.\n\nHalbreich’s associate directorship, which she assumed this past February, comes with no requirements for fundraising or capital expansion, though her responsibilities do include developing MoMA’s contemporary acquisitions, through the Fund for the 21st Century, and focusing the museum’s ‘pan-institutional contemporary programs and initiatives’. Given the museum’s sedentary reliance upon a conservative, male-centric account of modern art, expectations are high that Halbreich, Temkin and the other young hires stocking the museum’s departments will make the collection relevant to a twenty-first century audience. If How Latitudes Become Forms: Art in a Global Age, Halbreich’s 2003 Walker exhibition, is any indication, relevance is forthcoming. A four-year collaboration between curators and educators from the Walker and China, India, Brazil and South Africa resulted in a year-long series of programmes, performing arts commissions and a high school teaching curriculum. Here’s hoping that the Modern sees equal returns on Halbreich’s progressive approach.",

The past year has not been without setbacks for Nagy, and not just because India hasn’t been the new China. Bose Pacia, the New York gallery with which Nature Morte is partnered, is relocating as part of a recession-inspired regrouping. But Nagy’s Berlin, Kolkata (with Bose Pacia) and New Delhi galleries make him a key interface betweeen the Western and South Asian art scenes – a fact driven home by the crowds of people who visited his booth at India Art Summit this summer.",

I wear dungarees and T-shirts’, Richard Prince told Portfolio earlier this year, describing his love of a simple life before adding that in his spare time he’s ‘learning to fly my own plane’. This split personality has been on view in the artist’s exhibitions this past year, from his wrapping of the Hong Kong Museum of Art to appearing at the cool beating heart of the exhibition Sonic Youth Etc.: Sensational Fix. Auction prices for his work have plummeted, and he’s being sued for alleged copyright infringements, but Prince has been on display where it matters most: at the Met, in The Pictures Generation; Gagosian Madison Avenue, in a solo show; and not least Pinault’s new Dogana space in Venice.",

While his relaunched Saatchi Gallery has been cranking out voluminous attention-grabbing shows from the collection, the former ad man has found time to author an art-school realityshow contest, knock out a second book of quitefunny answers to interview questions and once more ruffle the official art establishment’s feathers, this time with an offer to donate his collection to the nation. In July, Saatchi announced plans to turn his gallery into ‘MoCA London’, gifting £25m of work to the UK, but the Arts Council has reportedly baulked at the condition that the gallery be able to sell from the collection to fund acquisitions. As we await the next chapter, Saatchi is still, entertainingly, throwing his weight around.",

            "For the New York Times’s senior art critic, 2010 has been about staying abreast of the gallery and museum scene’s postcrunch vagaries while keeping a calm eye on the latest developments in art itself. Smith has taken a pragmatic, hopeful approach to recession trends – giving a cautious welcome to the appointment of New York gallerist Jeffrey Deitch as the new director of crisis-ridden MOCA LA, for example. In terms of art criticism, among her standout commentaries was the assertion that painting isn’t dead; she has also been taking to task the ‘squeaky-clean, well-made, intellectually decorous’ products of fashionable postminimalism and Eurokunst ‘relational aesthetics’. Mildly conservative, pluralist and suspicious of hotheaded extremes, Smith remains the Big Apple’s bastion of responsible art criticism.",

So here you are, Jerry, comfortably nestled between Victoria Miro and the Zabludowiczes. Saltz’s artworld power is a slippery thing this year, given that he’s spent much of it cultivating mass appeal – both through his appearances as a judge on the Bravo reality contest Work of Art (2010) and in the slow buildup of his Facebook and Twitter tribes. Whether this populist approach has diluted his critical standing within the industry is not yet clear: he’s certainly picked some fights in his postings – with Robert Storr (over the Guggenheim’s YouTube biennial) and Klaus Biesenbach (calling the latter ‘a dick’ for his ‘pretty boring program’) – but made a lot more friends in doing so: 3,963 at last Facebook count.",

It suggests that Cattelan will enjoy a similar durability to these artists, and this implicit esteeming may have influenced the decision by Milan’s city authorities to green-light Against Ideology (2010), a sculptural one-finger salute in the direction of the Italian Stock Exchange, sited outside Cattelan’s four-work show at the Palazzo Reale Museum this September.

The move has seen Birnbaum shedding his previous commitments left, right and centre, resigning as rector of the influential Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main and as director of the exhibition space Portikus in the same city this April, both of which positions he’d held since 2001, as well as making an exit from the board of Manifesta, on which he’d sat since 2002. That said, he found time between CV-building to sit on various juries, including Victor Pinchuk’s Future Generation Art Prize and the inaugural Absolut Art Award, which he chaired – and which was won by Keren Cytter, a favourite of Birnbaum’s. And he remains one of the most erudite philosophers to tackle aesthetics and contemporary art practice.",

And he was briefly a significant owner of Sotheby’s stock, during which time 20 works from his collection were shown by the auction house (whatever the agreement there, when the stock rose sharply a short time later, Cohen promptly dumped it). This year, among other purchases, Cohen acquired a 1958 Jasper Johns Flag painting for a reported $110m. Still, it’s a shame when you’re so busy you can’t enjoy your own collection. He recently mentioned retiring to ‘just watch a fucking movie, or hang with my kids’. OK, he forgot to mention ‘and stare at the fucking Flag’, but we’re pretty sure he meant that, too.",

            "After ten years at the Pompidou’s helm, director Alfred Pacquement realised a longstanding dream this year with the opening of Pompidou-Metz, an outpost of France’s great modern and contemporary art museum. Many hopes are pinned on such regional branches, and the distinctive building – notably near the German border, designed by Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines, with a roof resembling a fallen net – is meant to beckon tourists on looks alone. It duly attracted 100,000 visitors in the first four days it was open. As well as an ongoing scheme to use vacant space at the Palais de Tokyo to show work by midcareer artists, Pacquement has announced plans for a ‘pop-up’ mobile Pompidou centre that will further the brand’s expansion. Oh, yes, and bring more art to the people. When it comes to world domination, it seems funding (currently holding up Pompidou Mobile) is the only thing standing in Pacquement’s way. That and the strikes which recently closed several of France’s leading museums for several days.",

            "A year ago there was muttering in the Somerset town of Bruton, England, that the arrival of fancy artworld types might turn the ancient parish into a rustic playground for the global ultra-rich. Once they’ve pulled on their wellies, however, it turns out that Wirth and his wife, Manuela Hauser, are ready to get down with both the mud and the cultural enrichment of his new ’hood. Hauser & Wirth Somerset – a converted seventeenth-century farmhouse and grounds, featuring multiple free-to-enter galleries, outdoor artworks and a buzzy restaurant – opened in July to general artworld approval, but perhaps more importantly, with a neighbourhood-pleasing programme of talks, workshops and site-relevant residencies. How this commitment to grassroots engagement will evolve to fit the decidedly more urban terrain of downtown LA when the 9,300sqm Hauser Wirth & Schimmel opens for business next year remains to be seen.",

            "‘Think the impossible’ is a central mantra down Serpentine Galleries way – one appended equally to exhibition-making and fundraising. For Peyton-Jones, this next year will be her 25th at the helm of the once-humble Hyde Park institution. Her appearance on the society pages alongside Pharrell Williams and other Serpentine partygoers has long been de rigueur, but as a finalist for the 2015 Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Award, Peyton-Jones has been explaining how annual visitor figures reached almost a million across the Serpentine’s two galleries in 2014, and how 85 percent of their £7m turnover is raised from private sources.\n\nCodirector Obrist is, as ever, ubiquitous: outlining the ‘Museum of the Future’ in Doha; touring 15 Rooms to Shanghai; winning the International Folkwang Prize in Essen. ‘In a sense Obrist is a human aggregator,’ wrote Hal Foster, reviewing Obrist’s Ways of Curating in the London Review of Books, ‘almost a social-media-in-person or a hive-mind of one.’ As might be expected, Ways of Curating is but one of 17-odd books authored or coauthored by the hyperactive uber-curator this year – and his river of published interviews and conversation is in turn cited in dozens of other publications. Obrist’s 103,000 Instagram followers chart his ceaseless travel through the location of celebrity contributors to his Post-it notes project – Orhan Pamuk in Istanbul; Olafur Eliasson in Copenhagen; Bret Easton Ellis, John Baldessari and Miranda July in LA – such that it is sometimes easy to forget his ties to an institutional ‘home’.",

            "Artworld connoisseurs love to hate Banksy, but the anonymous street artist’s power lies in the fact that he doesn’t need their support. Indeed, his market is booming. In October, Show Me the Monet, a take on the impressionist painter’s Water Lilies series, sold for a record £7.5m at auction. Prints Banksy stopped making in 2010 now command six-figure sums. Against establishment antipathy, others have reason to appreciate mystery-man’s success. In the summer MV Louise Michel was launched, a former French Customs boat refitted as a search-and-rescue vessel to assist migrants in peril on the Mediterranean, funded and decorated by Banksy. An exhibition of photographs of the artist’s work in Palestine was unveiled in August, a gesture recognising the diversified tourism to the state his stencil work has brought. One looming problem: in September the artist lost his battle to trademark his designs, in part because of his anonymity.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

Works from the collection are now an almost constant presence in the Benaki Museum, Athens, for instance, where this year Joannou cocurated a survey of work by the late Greek sculptor George Lappas. In June, while artist Roberto Cuoghi and his team were kiln-firing dozens of ceramic crabs as part of the artist’s Deste commission on Hydra, The Equilibrists opened at the Benaki, featuring a survey of young Greek art selected from open submission and through a hundred studio visits by New Museum curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Massimiliano Gioni. The last of these was on hand again to curate Urs Fischer – False Friends at the Museum of Art and History of Geneva, in which sculpture by the Swiss artist was buddied up with works by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons and Robert Gober – all owned by Joannou. ",

            "Just as you were the settling in to read last November’s Power 100 issue, Gorvy, the chairman and international head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s auction house, saw his New York saleroom hammer down Francis Bacon’s triptych Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) for $142.4m (£88.3m), the most expensive contemporary artwork ever sold at auction. That figure, along with the current vogue among collectors for paying high prices at auction for new works by very young artists, goes perhaps a little way towards accounting for the fact that sales of contemporary art now account for close to half of all auction business. For Gorvy, it’s booming, and with new collectors flooding in there’s no sign of a bust in sight. In a market like this one, and when your auction house is top of the food chain – Christie’s had record sales of just under £800m in the first six months of 2014, a rise of 20 percent over the same period in 2013 – you’re going to have to move jobs before you’ll be off this list.",

Like many of the galleries that have been able to expand through the recent economic chaos, Lévy and Mnuchin (a former equities trader and director of the New York Stock Exchange) split their operation between the secondary and primary markets, with the LA space their biggest statement yet of an intention to dominate the latter in the way they already dominate the former.",

And with its owners having recently acquired a majority stake in Hong Kong’s ART HK fair, Art Basel will be part of an organisation whose reach spans the globe, further concentrating the power of art fairs in the culture of the artworld.

            "With art ‘flippers’ hogging the media limelight, Anita Zabludowicz’s ongoing commitment to artists can be seen with new respect. She has established herself as a major collector, increasingly internationally, with an eye (helped by a curatorial team) for what fits with her and husband Poju’s London-based private institution (together with a space on Broadway in New York and a residency programme on an island in Poju’s native Finland). In September Anita told The New York Times, ‘We prefer artists who like to work on longterm projects with institutions. The get-richquick painters are another story.’ So no ‘crapstraction’, then. This policy is borne out in their shows over the past year, including Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch (on now), Michael E. Smith, Adriano Costa, Heather Phillipson and, from an older generation, Albert Oehlen. Over in Finland hotshots Caragh Thuring, Sam Falls and Nicolas Deshayes holed up on the island to make work, as various vIps stopped by to take a peek.   ",

May You Live in Interesting Times was too Western-centric for some – almost a third of the artists were based in the US – but the overall critical consensus was a pretty solid ‘B’. ‘Intermittent bursts of urgency and the occasional surprise’ was the verdict of Adrian Searle in The Guardian, while Jason Farago admired the artist list in The New York Times but felt that Rugoff had nonetheless played it ‘safe’. Meanwhile, Zoé Whitley joined Rugoff’s Hayward Gallery from the Tate (and fresh off curating the British Pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale). Whatever the critics thought of Venice, Rugo can count on one fan: in June, he was awarded an OBE by the Queen.",

Mobile Homestead (2010), an ambitious public project that will see a replica of his childhood home make a journey from midtown Detroit to the suburbs where Kelley grew up, is the artist’s first public project anywhere in the world to result in a permanent installation. It’s proof of his continuing ability to remain on the perceived fringes while creating work that is undeniably significant, and which has a wide and lasting influence.",

(Given this supportive emphasis, it’s unsurprising that Philbin describes the Hammer’s primary audience as artists.) Though region-based selections may have their problems, in a period in which there are fears about the homogenisation of the LA museums (due to the growing powers of Eli Broad and MOCA), the Hammer and LAXART will help to guarantee a strong home–city scene.",

            "This year Sharp and Slotover have taken a step back from running the fairs they founded in London (that’ll be Frieze London and Frieze Masters, the latter the duo’s venture into not-so-contemporary art) and New York. Victoria Siddall, trusted longtime Frieze employee, takes over, along with a couple of recently appointed deputies, and is now in overall charge of day-to-day stuff like making sure the right galleries get into the fairs and overseeing the nonprofit projects and public programmes. \n\nSo what have Sharp and Slotover been doing with their spare time? Nobody outside the firm knows, and Sharp and Slotover remain tight-lipped. Last winter Slotover was in Beijing to launch Frieze content onto Chinese social media platforms, so questions as to a possible extension or buy-in into Asia were raised. Then there’s Slotover’s influence back in London: besides chairing the board of South London Gallery, he sits on the board of Create London, a nonprofit public-art-commissioning body that supports community-focused projects by artists in the city’s East End.",

            "Being dubbed ‘the Bob Ross of light art meets climate change’ by Artnet\nis a backhanded compliment, but like the late American TV personality, Eliasson has enormous appeal. His big hits might be behind him (for now at least), but the voracious mingling of art, architecture, ecology and new technology continues unabated. A solo exhibition at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, which featured old classics as well as new commissions (including Under the Weather, 2022, a huge elliptical patterned screen hanging above the building’s courtyard that changes as the viewer moves about), was also a chance to launch a trippy ever-changing colour-field virtual-reality NFT (commissioned by Beeple collector Metakovan). The artist’s aim – whether he’s producing gallery shows (in Seoul, Madrid, Los Angeles), institutional exhibitions (additional solos at Castello di Rivoli and Munich’s Pinakothek), largescale outdoor commissions (for a Californian winery, or in the Qatari desert) or magazine covers (produced for Time ahead of COP27) – is to make the viewer acutely aware of their – and the – environment.",

            "Speaking to The Korea Times during the opening of Correspondence: Lee Ufan and Mark Rothko at Pace’s Seoul branch, CEO Glimcher was in a philosophical mood. ‘Artists are creating something that’s purely of the spirit, but we’re hoping someone will actually spend money on it. And that’s because money is a symbol of reality, while art represents something beyond it. We’re essentially trying to exchange one for the other.’ To sell the spirit of 132 artists, collectives and artist estates, you need a lot of real estate. Following the establishment of its us home (two addresses in New York, where it is headquartered, and one in la), Pace expanded into Asia 16 years ago, first to Beijing (since closed) and then to Seoul and Hong Kong (it also has galleries in London and Geneva). This year it opened a Sou Fujimoto-designed space in Tokyo, giving a local home to Japan-based gallery artists Yoshitomo Nara, Lee Ufan and TeamLab. Pace Tokyo, however, used its new three-storey gallery to first show the paintings of Maysha Mohamedi, followed by those of Arlene Shechet.",

Golden has ably stewarded the Studio Museum of Harlem for the past 15 years, renewing its curatorial and educational programming (Legacy Russell was appointed associate curator in 2018), creating one of the most sought-after residency programmes in the US and updating its physical plant with a $122m purpose-built, David Adjaye-designed building. This year she was invited to join an elite group of Black museum trustees in the creation of the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums (Golden sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), funded by the Mellon and Ford foundations, whose aims are the cultivation of new Black talent at all levels of visual art practice and administration – something Golden knows well, as this has been her mission since beginning her career in the arts in 1987 as an intern at the museum she now leads.\n\n\nThe ArtReview Power 100 is presented by BMW Group Culture",

            "In the sense that there’ve been no newspaper hogging auctions or switches of direction, Damien Hirst has had a relatively unassuming year. Which means numerous exhibitions: at L&M Arts in New York, Gagosian in New York, Galería Hilario Galguera in New Mexico and Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum. This last retrospective not only found Hirst partying with Albert II, the principality’s crown prince; it also included spot, spin and butterfly paintings, all series which, he announced at the Gagosian show (entitled End of an Era), he would no longer be producing.\n\nThis may to some extent slow the shrinking of Hirst’s market – down by 93 percent last year and bound to be lower this annum – and allay the artist’s detractors, who in August reiterated and expanded on accusations of plagiarism. A charge Hirst branded ‘gibberish’. Still, Hirst isn’t one for cooling his heels. His Murderme art collection grows apace, his Other Criteria publishing wing and retail outlets continue to turn out books, sell multiples and support exhibitions – and he’s rumoured to have a longterm gig booked in: a Tate retrospective to coincide with London’s 2012 Olympics. ",

Still, a routine year for Enwezor nevertheless involved Performa’s annual gala being dedicated to him; officially this was for his catalytic role in raising the visibility of South African art, though the visibility of art from all of Africa and the diaspora would, surely, be very different without Enwezor’s evangelising over the 20 years since his first major curatorial project. Meanwhile, the typically ambitious programme he oversees at Munich’s Haus der Kunst included major monographic shows (James Casebere, Michael Buthe and an upcoming one by Joana Hadjithomas & Khalil Joreige), and the whopping global survey Postwar – Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic 1945–65. In January he signed on for another five years at HDK: a no-brainer on its part, though Enwezor will no doubt pop up in many other places too. ",

Broad (together with wife Edythe) wants to be the art angel in the City of Angels, creating press and fanfare whenever he gives. And give he undeniably does.\n\nThere are fears being voiced from LA’s art community that Broad is having a significant homogenising influence on the city’s museums. Press coverage of Broad is filled with sideswipes and barely concealed irritation on the part of patrons, curators and museum directors (except those he supports or those waiting for a cheque).\n\nThe truth is, however, that museums need Broad like never before: California has a 12 percent unemployment rate and a $20b deficit, and financial cuts are being made left, right and centre. Broad, with a fortune valued at $5.7b, has pledged to give 75 percent of it away. And the building of the Broad collection museum on Grand Avenue, designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which is now getting under way in earnest, should keep him busy for the time being.",

Continuing to represent a broad spectrum of international artists, the gallery’s more established lineup, which includes Turner Prize-winners Wolfgang Tillmans and Gillian Wearing, and nominees Rebecca Warren and Liam Gillick, is balanced by shows of artists lesser known or less seen in London. \n\nThis year the gallery hosted first exhibitions by structuralist LA filmmaker Morgan Fisher and New York artist and activist Tim Rollins and K.O.S. Other shows featured new paintings by Cologne-based Michael Krebber; an immersive installation by photographer Anne Hardy; and text and image works by established ‘walking’ artist Hamish Fulton.",

However, Miro has come back with a major addition of her own this year, in the form of an elegant new gallery space in London’s Mayfair. And other gallery artists continue to maintain a high profile. \n\nElmgreen & Dragset’s exhibitions in 2013 have included a yearlong public project in Munich’s main squares and a major site-specific installation in the old textile galleries at the V&A in London. Meanwhile the ever-popular and populist Grayson Perry becomes the first visual artist to deliver the BBC’s annual Reith Lectures. The recent addition of Kara Walker to the gallery’s roster won’t do any harm either. ",

For his Autumn/ Winter collection for Saint Laurent, Hedi Slimane issued an invitation and showbook featuring artwork supplied by Baldessari and centred the collection around three heavily-sequined dresses inspired by the artist’s 50-year career. Sticking to things French: the artist also unveiled a 30m-long light installation in Paris titled Your Name in Lights (2011), in which members of the public’s names are… well, you get the picture. Yet it was back home that Baldessari showed what an artworld powerhouse he is – beyond, even, the fact of his canonical art – when he, alongside peers Barbara Kruger and Catherine Opie, gave MoCA’s new director, Philippe Vergne, a vote of confidence by returning to the beleaguered museum’s board in March this year, after having left it in June 2012 in protest at the direction Jeffrey Deitch was taking the institution.  ",

However, as the head of Kaikai Kiki (the artist’s art production company), Murakami has successfully introduced his artists into the artworld. Murakami’s personal career is still flourishing: two solo gallery shows (in Hong Kong and LA) and one institutional show, Takashi in Superflat Wonderland, at Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul. His debut feature film, Jellyfish Eyes (2013), had its international premiere in April. And the Japanese makeup brand Shu Uemura has announced a cosmetics collection, titled Six Hearts Princes, based on Murakami’s 6HP anime project.",

This will add to the multiple addresses he’s opened since founding the gallery in Paris in 1990, currently including Hong Kong (opened in 2012), New York (2013), Seoul (2016), Tokyo (2017), Shanghai (2019) and Los Angeles (2023). Where Perrotin won’t be having future shows however is Dubai: the secondary market space the gallerist opened in 2022 with dealers Tom-David Bastok and Dylan Lessel closed after their collaboration was dissolved in February (Bastok and Lessel will continue alone in the UAE and with the five-storey space they and Perrotin ran in Paris). In keeping with Perrotin’s populist bent, however, the gallery collaborated with eBay to sell limited-edition objects and prints with the aim of making ‘art and fine objects accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget’, by the likes of gallery artists including Takashi Murakami, Daniel Arsham and JR.",

For to be the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art involves a lot of fundraising and a head for figures. These are likely prefixed by dollar signs and suffixed by ‘million’: the $650m needed to complete LACMA’s teardown-and-rebuild capital project; the $117.5m Govan secured from LA County in April. Or they might refer to missing square metres, after it emerged that Peter Zumthor’s design will include 10 percent less area than the planned 36,000sqm. Or be attached to the deal with Budi Tek’s Yuz Museum, with which LACMA will partner on a jointly owned foundation managing 90 percent of the Indonesian-Chinese entrepreneur’s collection. Govan knows that making art accessible in California requires an unholy alliance of number crunching and celebrity: hence roping in Kanye West to donate $10m to James Turrell’s decades-awaited Roden Crater.",

(Koons donated the concept, not the finished work; one critic called it a ‘poisoned chalice’.) Despite this, Koons remains undeterred, focusing on a series of bags being created with Louis Vuitton: a Mona Lisa backpack or a Rubens duffel, anyone? When it comes to an unruffled engagement with capitalism and the smoothest of productions, Koons remains king. ",

(Figurative painting is extremely in.) The details may change, but Coles’s gallery has been on the money in every sense for over 20 years now. Earlier this year, she gave over her main space to modish writer/critic Charlie Fox, who filled it with a spooked, spacey group show orbiting around monstrosity, while elsewhere the gallery gave real estate to brash New York multimedia artist Borna Sammak and recent signee and rising digital-art star Lawrence Lek, while also finding space for trad blue-chipper Elizabeth Peyton (ahead of her National Portrait Gallery retrospective in London). Meanwhile, stalwarts like Sarah Lucas, Helen Marten and Matthew Barney continued to mop up the institutional shows and demonstrate Coles’s ability to keep di¢erent bases covered.",

By contrast, London sales throughout the year proved strong, if not earth-shattering, but for Westphal – chairman of contemporary art Europe – the auction game may be changing anyway: in October, Sotheby’s expanded its S/2 private sales gallery format from New York to London, effectively muscling in on the business of gallerists and private dealers.\n\nPrivate sales are a growth area for Sotheby’s, so S/2 London plans five selling shows a year. Sotheby’s shareholders seem to like it: the company’s shares have risen continuously, even while billionaire activist investor Dan Loeb has recently been gunning for Sotheby’s CEO William Ruprecht to step down.",

            "There are many reasons why Matthew Marks is a perennial figure on this list, but all of them come back to the artists the New York and LA gallerist works with. King among these is Jasper Johns (who exhibited over 30 years of monotypes in one of three NY spaces this year). The American star has this to say about his gallerist: ‘Artists… like to think that they are the center of attention. I think Matthew is capable of making artists feel that.’ His other artists are no less iconic; considered as a group, they feel like a who’s who of American art and beyond. Between Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Ron Nagle, Charles Ray, Brice Marden (who had a show of new paintings in LA earlier in the year) and the late Ellsworth Kelly, one could write the history of the country. Couple them with Thomas Demand, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch and Luigi Ghirri (who also got a show in New York) and Marks’s skill at making each of them feel the most important person in the room is doubly impressive. ",

Nine years later there is more than enough evidence to suggest she stands by this vow. ‘Aggie’ Gund doesn’t just dash into MoMA once in a while to fulfil her role as its president emerita or as chairman of MoMA PS1; she gets involved. In September she even appeared on PS1 director Klaus Biensenbach’s Instagram feed doing stretches in preparation for a rehearsal of a Xavier Le Roy performance (the artist currently has a show at PS1). Besides MoMA, Gund chairs the Mayor of New York’s Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, is founder of the Studio in a School Association, is on the board of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and is honorary trustee of Independent Curators International and, in her hometown of Cleveland, of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art. She collects, she donates, she’s irrepressible. ",

Times change, but Gillick keeps his eye trained on the intersection of aesthetics and capital, as he has done for the past two decades. While his output ranges from architectural installation to sculpture, his videoworks took centre stage at the Madre Museum in Naples this summer. If his work affects the corporate aesthetic – his exhibition at Maureen Paley, London, in September consisted of slick architectural interventions and more films – then visitors to Kunsthalle Wien in July would have been reassured that Gillick puts his heart and soul into his work, as they witnessed the production of a feature film he is making with Austrian collective Gelitin. He is equally influential behind closed doors, sitting on the steering committee of Maja Hoffmann’s Luma Foundation. With such consistent success, Gillick’s blue Mondays should be few and far between.",

The issuing of the seventh edition this year was notably delayed, not once but twice, due to Russia’s invasion. In October, however, the winner was finally announced: Bangladeshi artist Ashfika Rahman, chosen from a shortlist of 21 by a big-name jury that included Cecilia Alemani [https://artreview.com/artist/cecilia-alemani/] and Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung [https://artreview.com/artist/bonaventure-soh-bejeng-ndikung/]. Pinchuk, who Donald Trump once called ‘a very, very special man’ (and who hired Kellyanne Conway, an official in the 45th president’s administration, as his lobbyist this year), bankrolled a vast exhibition during the Venice Biennale [https://artreview.com/explore-venice-biennale-2024/] titled From Ukraine: Dare to Dream, in which artists ranging from Shilpa Gupta to Nikita Kadan to Otobong Nkanga [https://artreview.com/artist/otobong-nkanga-2/] reflected on what the curators described as ‘an ongoing power struggle’, while ‘storms and climate change ravage lands far and wide’ and ‘political extremes are seizing their growing momentum’. For Pinchuk, then, art undoubtedly has geopolitical purchase.",

That loss is not always a bad thing was perhaps the message of Brian Belott, the self-proclaimed ‘Master of Discard’, who closed the gallery with his thrift-store assemblages. Nor is Brown likely to mope: he had four artists in the international exhibition at the Venice Biennale – Ed Atkins, Frida Orupabo, Avery Singer and Golden Lion winner Arthur Jafa – with Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys representing Belgium. There were also shows for Alex Katz and Ella Kruglyanskaya in his Harlem space and Charlemagne Palestine and Laura Owens at his Rome outpost, while Karl Holmqvist joined the restaurant/gallery that Brown and Rirkrit Tiravanija run in upstate New York. This autumn there was a trip to Paris to stage a show at Galerie Patrick Seguin.",

After 46 years, Lisson is still an artworld cuckoo in the unhipsterish nest of Edgware Road, but this unlikely ’hood is the London home to Nicholas Logsdail’s multigenerational family of artists. This last year, weapon-mangling Pedro Reyes and claymation heroes Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg have also been welcomed into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile Lisson’s senior artists continue to assert themselves on a global scale – Ai Weiwei and Anish Kapoor have had significant international exhibitions and Marina Abramović has been, well, everywhere. After opening its first international space in Milan two years ago, Lisson recently set up a by-appointment office in New York: rumour has it that a full stateside gallery is soon to follow.",

            "The ‘wolf in cashmere’ recently became the third richest person in the world. As chairman and CEO of luxury group LVMH, a little bit of his Bloomberg-estimated $97.3bn fortune goes to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. This year the private museum gave over its galleries to Gilbert & George, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Courtauld’s hallowed collection of Impressionism. The foundation’s smaller ‘espaces’ in Venice and Tokyo, meanwhile, hosted shows by Philippe Parreno and Christian Boltanski respectively. Yet it was an even more spectacular brand of philanthropy that put Arnault and his family in the spotlight this year, after they publicly announced a €200m donation to Notre-Dame while the cathedral was still smouldering (conveniently overshadowing the €100m earlier pledged by his nemesis François Pinault). Sceptics suggested that Arnault would benefit from a tax break (he says not), and sniping over this and other megadonations was only partially quelled when, in September, they were eventually signed off.",

This last was Robert Colescott, whose paintings, which Blum & Poe hung at their Los Angeles gallery in March, combined surrealism with satire to comment on the state of race politics. Also joining the gallery was young West Coaster Mimi Lauter, who had a show in May, Chicago-based Tony Lewis, Brazilian Solange Pessoa and Japan’s Tomoo Gokita. The gallery has had a presence in Gokita’s hometown of Tokyo since 2014, and it was there, in June, that it showed Agnès Varda. The New Wave filmmaker is undergoing something of a renaissance (and, in collaborations with JR, being embraced by the artworld). That the boys are championing an older artist proves something of a theme: they also gave octogenarian sculptor Wendell Dayton his first major solo show.",

Then again, the collector (and MoMA board member) whose donations to the museum between 1997 and 2016 form this sweeping survey of Latin American art, Sur moderno: Journeys of Abstraction – The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift, is hardly your ordinary buyer. Her holdings, concentrating on art from Latin America, are constantly on loan, as well as increasingly being gifted directly to institutions. For example, the Reina Sofía in Madrid was given 45 works by 33 artists (all made since 1990) in March from the Phelps de Cisneros collection, a bequest that followed another donation of 202 works in January to Reína Sofia, MoMA and five other international museums. Hers is a name worth remembering for independent curators and scholars, too: Phelps de Cisneros is the purse behind various residencies and research fellowships, including the Independent Curators International’s annual travel grant.",

Aside from continued support for YBA veterans (with whom Jopling made his name during the 1990s), including a much-lauded solo by Tracey Emin in London, the dealer represents some of the most sought-after artists working in the US, including Julie Mehretu [https://artreview.com/artist/julie-mehretu-2/] and Theaster Gates [https://artreview.com/artist/theaster-gates/?year=2022] (who presented in New York at the beginning of the year). The roster expanded on both ends to welcome twenty-eight-year-old painter Alia Ahmad and artist, curator and activist Howardena Pindell, now in her eighties. On the less shiny side of things, the gallery has faced criticism for sacking its team of invigilators (mostly artists and students) and replacing them with security guards – citing ‘a general trend across similar galleries that are moving away from visitor engagement to visitor management’. The London gallery closes out this year with a much-anticipated exhibition [https://artreview.com/does-tableau-photography-deserve-to-survive-jeff-wall-white-cube-opinion-dorrell-merritt/] of over 30 key works by Jeff Wall.",

On lease from the city council, the Bourse is the new backdrop for rotating thematic displays drawing from the luxury-goods magnate’s more-than 3,000-piece art collection, with an emphasis on artists of colour such as David Hammons and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who have had little visibility in France. Programming at his Venice spaces continued with a much-lauded survey of Bruce Nauman at the Punta della Dogana, while the collection built on its offsite presence across France: organising a show at Le Fresnoy for artist-in-residence Enrique Ramírez and an exhibition featuring work by 57 artists from the collection in Rennes, and lending 19 works by Jeff Koons for a retrospective at Marseille’s MUCEM. Meanwhile Christie’s – which Pinault owns – hosted the first-ever NFT auction, hammering down Beeple’s Everydays (2021) at a record $69m.",

            "As any Richter historian will tell you: trying to pinpoint a sense of style to the artist’s work is a task doomed to failure. For the past six decades Richter has famously moved relentlessly between abstraction and figuration, from gloomy monochrome to bright experimentation in colour. The uniting factor, Richter’s subject, if you like, being painting itself. Given his refusal to a ‘signature’ aesthetic, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the painter has no truck with the ‘cult of personality’ he believes to now surround contemporary artists. ‘It’s a frightening development,’ he bemoaned to Die Zeit this year. Other than the usual dizzying sales – Liu Yiqian posted a picture on WeChat of the 11m-long stripe painting he bought from Marian Goodman, Eric Clapton is selling a Richter valued at $20m – it’s been a relatively quiet year for Richter: just the one museum show and a trio of gallery exhibitions (including at Goodman’s New York space in May). But his influence on painting globally remains big.  ",

            "Since 1977, when, after an early foray into multiples, she opened her New York gallery with a show by Marcel Broodthaers, Goodman has dedicated her considerable energies to promoting exchange between the American and European artworlds. She’s made good on that for four decades since, opening further spaces in Paris in 1995, London in 2014 and yet another project space/bookshop in Paris in 2016. Her rhythms are relatively slow, steady, circumspect; she’s not seeking a foothold in Asia, she’s developing the dream lineup she already has, from Gerhard Richter to Pierre Huyghe, Steve McQueen (subject of a major Tate retrospective next year) to Tacita Dean. In 2019 her galleries bodied forth shows by William Kentridge, John Baldessari, Annette Messager and more, while her most noted London schedule might have been Danh Vo’s ambitious wood workshop using, of course, historically significant wood (from the McNamara family timber company). His gallerist, too, remains a beacon for considered creativity in the present tense.",

            "‘While I agree that there have been great strides in making things better, we still have a ways to go before there’s real parity,’ wrote Sherman as part of an online debate on sexism in the artworld earlier this year. ‘I am well aware that my prices aren’t anywhere near those of my male counterparts, and while it annoys the hell out of me, I also think, How can I complain when I’m still doing so well?’ Well, quite. By any yardstick, Sherman is pretty close to the top of the tree: number five this year on the major-exhibition-derived Kunstkompass rankings; number ten on the list of most expensive living American artists; number three on the list of most expensive living female artists. \n\nAuction prices are, of course, a dismal barometer of merit – so how about popular status? Sherman’s is such that one fan issued a free set of emojis, allowing Cindyphiles to communicate in her image. As for legacy, the Pictures Generation is now looked to as the spiritual forebear of the post-Internet generation as it grapples with a sea of rapidly proliferating, authorless images, the lack of disconnect between advertising and selfexpression, and the increasing commodification of self-image. Sherman has become an informal patron saint to every artist attempting to undermine the selfie or turn Instagram to her own purposes. If anyone can smash that glass ceiling, she’ll be the one to do it.",

A serial biennial curator, who also hops nimbly between the worlds of public institutions and private foundations, Gioni is artistic director of the Beatrice Trussardi Foundation in his native Italy and the curator of Dark Light: Realism in the Age of Post-Truth at the Aïshti Foundation in Beirut, which featured over 200 works from the collection of Tony and Elham Salamé and focused on the changing meanings of figuration in contemporary art. Proving he can also nip between the worlds of fashion and art, in Doha he is the cocurator of the current Valentino show, Forever Valentino, and, earlier this year, the Jeff Koons survey Lost in America.",

Of course, at each of these outings Ai used his platform to address political subjects dear to him: ‘We are talking about many, many things. We are talking about immigrants, about deaths, about the war,’ he told the Associated Press in Venice. He used the launch of a limited-edition rug to rally against animal cruelty; an installation in Quebec City to return to the plight of refugees; his production of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926) at the Teatro dell’Opera, Rome, to support Julian Assange; and his win of Japan’s ¥15m (approx £90,000) Praemium Imperiale to bemoan the death\nof free speech in the West.",

            "It has been a turbulent 12 months since the head of the four Tate galleries took the number one spot on this list. While discontent and protest ﬁtfully surfaced from the activist-left over BP’s corporate sponsorship, in the spring it was Serota’s detractors on the right who made the most noise. The conservative press gleefully stretched for Oscar Wilde clichés when Tate lost not one but two directors in quick succession. Was it carelessness on Serota’s part? Perhaps not, but Penelope Curtis leaving Tate Britain for Calouste Gulbenkian Museum after a much maligned ﬁve-year tenure, and Chris Dercon announcing his decision to jump ship from Tate Modern to direct Berlin’s Volksbühne (although he’ll be staying in the post until next summer) was not a good look for Serota. \n\nThe ten-storey extension, which dwarfs Tate Modern’s original building like a super cruiseliner on the Venetian skyline, is proving controversial too. Currently four years behind its original opening date – during which performance spaces in the power station’s old oil tanks, opened to much hype in 2012, have sat idle as construction continues above them – the additional space is still missing £30m of funding, although Serota says he is conﬁdent this will be found before the new launch date of June 2016. Last year’s top spot came in recognition of Tate’s vast international network of global acquisitions committees and internationally active curatorial teams. No change there. Nor has all the construction dented its exhibition programme (Tanks aside) and general popularity with punters: a(nother) record – 7.9 million visits across all four sites in 2014–15, with 5.7 million alone stepping into Tate Modern. But with his legacy projects nearing completion, is the sixty-nine-year-old eyeing retirement in some pleasant corner of Southern England?.  ",

            "For the past few years the press has been speculating on seventy-nine-year-old Larry Gagosian’s succession plans for what is regularly estimated as a business with a $1 billion annual turnover (accumulated through the sale of works by the likes of Nan Goldin [https://artreview.com/artist/nan-goldin/], Carol Bove and Richard Prince [https://artreview.com/richard-prince-clearview-ai-and-your-face-gagosian/], who each had a show this year in at least one of Gagosian’s 19 galleries around the world). There was talk of Gagosian implementing a corporate structure, but that narrative was thrown into disarray this summer with the ousting of Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer for the past five years and a rumoured successor. For some, the gallery is already far too financially oriented. Thomas Houseago, upon leaving Gagosian this year, remarked, ‘Is that a warm environment? See the people at the desks? You see the terror in their eyes.’ But Gagosian is also keen to remind people of his own legacy within the industry. Earlier this year he returned to the shop floor to curate Jean-Michel Basquiat: Made on Market Street, an exhibition focused on the work Basquiat created in LA after taking up Gagosian’s invitation to come and stay awhile during the early 1980s.",

            "Zwirner’s eponymous gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by doing the thing megagalleries like to do best: adding more artists to its roster. Painter Emma McIntyre was the gallery’s youngest artist when she joined back in February, until Sasha Gordon was signed up at the age of twenty-six in September. Both have retained the representation of their original galleries, as have Walter Prize and Raymond Saunders (who also joined the gallery earlier this year): it’s a move that is indicative of Zwirner’s long-held belief that the gallery ecosystem should be more collegiate. Balancing out the age average, seventy-eight-year-old Scott Kahn came onboard too. In May the gallery opened a new three-storey flagship in Los Angeles, its third in the city, highlighting a commitment to bricks and mortar (there are eight further addresses across New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong) over digital sales: in August Zwirner made ten e-commerce employees redundant, and Platform, a Zwirner-financed digital marketplace selling work and merch by emerging artists, launched a new micro art fair in Chelsea.",
